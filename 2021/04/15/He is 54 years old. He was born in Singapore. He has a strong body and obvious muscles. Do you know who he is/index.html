        <p>Many people don’t have a good impression on greasy middle-aged uncles. They think that this kind of men with fat belly and beer belly generally have low self-discipline. Is it true that all men will become greasy uncles as soon as they reach middle age? No, there is such a man, Chen chuanduo, who is known as the immortal legend. He is a cool uncle.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2021/04/15/He is 54 years old. He was born in Singapore. He has a strong body and obvious muscles.
