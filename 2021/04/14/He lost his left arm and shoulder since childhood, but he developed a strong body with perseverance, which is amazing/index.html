        <p>Today, I’m talking about a special fitness enthusiast whose fitness videos have spread all over the world. He is not the strongest, but I admire him the most! Nine times out of ten, life is not satisfactory. When you complain about the unfairness of fate, someone is fighting against it. This is the master of today.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2021/04/14/He lost his left arm and shoulder since childhood, but he developed a strong body with perseverance, which is amazing/b5864f1e-9487-4f70-b3ee-a4ec5768195d.gif" alt="He lost his left arm and shoulder since childhood, but he developed a strong body with perseverance, which is amazing"><br>His name is Luke. From a very young age, he has been teased by fate. Arms, shoulders and most of the left lung. This is what he lacks more than ordinary people. Because they are different from normal people, they are often ridiculed. It makes him more and more sensitive. He even felt abandoned by the world.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2021/04/14/He lost his left arm and shoulder since childhood, but he developed a strong body with perseverance, which is amazing/5958a5c6-ccb2-4b59-a4b3-960979970380.gif" alt="He lost his left arm and shoulder since childhood, but he developed a strong body with perseverance, which is amazing"><br>Fortunately, he has the best mother in the world. Never give up on him, give him the confidence to live. It was because of his mother’s words that he was reborn in the fire.<br>“Although your body is different from other ordinary people, you can do whatever you want. Like ordinary people, you have to be brave. “<br>In addition to learning to smile and face life. He also learned that despite his physical defects, you have to be strong and brave.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2021/04/14/He lost his left arm and shoulder since childhood, but he developed a strong body with perseverance, which is amazing/ab08b8f9-dce7-456d-93a7-94adee341418.gif" alt="He lost his left arm and shoulder since childhood, but he developed a strong body with perseverance, which is amazing"><br>When Luke first came into contact with the barbell, he fell in love with the fun of this power, and he was out of control from then on.

Although he has only one hand, his training intensity is no less than that of ordinary people, and even harder than others. He can push with one hand, lift weights with one hand, and play with one hand on the war rope.<br><img src="http://doumaiy.xyz/2021/04/14/He lost his left arm and shoulder since childhood, but he developed a strong body with perseverance, which is amazing/6bff4408-66b8-4e71-9713-95570771339f.gif" alt="He lost his left arm and shoulder since childhood, but he developed a strong body with perseverance, which is amazing"><br>Fitness is not an easy thing, not to mention Luke.
