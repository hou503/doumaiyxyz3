Lao Zhan, let him vote for the next thunder fight/5a1a063285134b149e68f5ddaced3b19.jpg" alt="0 points, three more points after the game! Lao Zhan, let him vote for the next thunder fight"><br>On November 18, a regular season NBA game ended at noon, the Lakers beat the Hawks 122-101 at home. While winning four times in a row, they continued to rank first in the West and the league with 11-2 record! In fact, the hug between James and Kobe Bryant, as Lakers fans, may feel very warm. Two superstars, representing two times, wear purple and gold robes, which is a continuation and inheritance.<br>But as witnesses of the two times, Howard and Bryant embrace, it’s really a moment of mixed flavor! Howard really failed to live up to Kobe’s trust, and Kobe didn’t meet the most hardworking Howard. If there’s a moonlight box, maybe the person Howard wants to make up for most is Kobe. From Kobe Bryant’s second in charge in the past to the team’s dirty cleaners, Howard, you’ve touched people so much!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/0 points, three more points after the game! Lao Zhan, let him vote for the next thunder fight/6b178e7809e84e48a96977c691a6eb84.jpg" alt="0 points, three more points after the game! Lao Zhan, let him vote for the next thunder fight"><br>2 points, 9 rebounds, plus or minus + 18, second only to Zhan. In other words, Howard is a barrier on the defensive end of the Lakers, refusing all threatening shots, and flying a big cap is Howard’s duty! On the offensive end, Howard made 0 shots today! But I got two fouls, four free throws and two goals.<br>Kobe left first with Gianna and followed the whistle. Zhan enjoyed staples’ cheers and shouts. He walked back to the dressing room with the fans after clapping. The fans walked clean in twos and threes. The court was empty. Finally, there was a place to practice! Howard, with the help of Lakers trainers, began to try long-distance projection. According to the video shooting location, Howard should be standing on the three-point line or relatively far away!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/0 points, three more points after the game! Lao Zhan, let him vote for the next thunder fight/8cf3ee1f14d14512836f9c125333f30d.jpg" alt="0 points, three more points after the game! Lao Zhan, let him vote for the next thunder fight"><br>Three shots, all hit!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/0 points, three more points after the game!

Lao Zhan, let him vote for the next thunder fight"><br>After the thrilling victory over the Suns, Howard practices free throws, and after the back-to-back victory over the warriors, Howard practices confrontation. After the victory over the king, Howard urgently needs to practice. After this game, he still needs to practice! Howard’s post game practice is just like the press conference and post game interview for the Lakers. It’s a fixed thing to know that Howard still hasn’t been promised by the Lakers, and he may leave at any time.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/0 points, three more points after the game! Lao Zhan, let him vote for the next thunder fight/b3f023dc091048448a7deeef1e31cab0.jpg" alt="0 points, three more points after the game! Lao Zhan, let him vote for the next thunder fight"><br>On November 20, the Lakers played thunder at home. When Zhan scored 33 points today, he also sent 12 assists and 0 mistakes. I really hope to see Howard’s efforts paid off. I really want to see that Howard has no worries like in the past. But now Howard is really different. He has to do more dirty work than bushbrow and McGee. McGee can be involved in the attack, and Howard has to face the most fierce outside impact of the other side!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/0 points, three more points after the game! Lao Zhan, let him vote for the next thunder fight/8f6891c6d2d5477291801ed3489e3c0b.jpg" alt="0 points, three more points after the game! Lao Zhan, let him vote for the next thunder fight"><br>Old Zhan, when playing thunder, give Howard a chance to shoot. It’s very simple for you, but I believe it’s very important for Howard!</p>

    <title>10 points 5 mistakes, plus or minus - 20! Anthony, wait a year, you&#39;re not like Howard</title>
    <url>/2019/11/23/10%20points%205%20mistakes,%20plus%20or%20minus%20-%2020!%20Anthony,%20wait%20a%20year,%20you&#39;re%20not%20like%20Howard/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In an NBA regular season game that ended on the morning of November 20, Pelican met with Blazers at home and two brothers in the West. Before the game, blazers announced that Lillard could not play because of back spasm. Coach stoz put Anthony, who had just signed the contract officially, on the starting line before the game. Before the match, in the words of Duan ran, Anthony will get a lot of opportunities in this match. It is expected that he will get at least 10 points! 104-115, the trailblazer lost again, Anthony appeared for 24 minutes, beyond the time arranged by stoz, how was his performance?<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/10 points 5 mistakes, plus or minus - 20! Anthony, wait a year, you're not like Howard/dfe02cc5c3f64fec8aae40d08182d0ab.jpg" alt="10 points 5 mistakes, plus or minus - 20! Anthony, wait a year, you&#39;re not like Howard"><br>Anthony went out for 24 minutes, 4 out of 14 hit rate, including 3-pointers, 2 out of 3, 10 points, 4 rebounds, 1 block, 5 mistakes and 5 fouls, plus or minus 20. It’s very embarrassing. In fact, in the third quarter, Anthony is the most often shot by the Blazers, not mclem, not Hood! According to the way pioneers used to play, when Lillard was absent or was off the court, mclem was the main attack point, and with batesmere or hood, they were looking for opportunities to kill on the flank, but today the whole pioneer gave Anthony all the opportunities. Starting from the first quarter, mclem had the chance to break through, not to break out, and hood had the chance to shoot three points on the outside line. If he didn’t, he had to play for Anthony.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/10 points 5 mistakes, plus or minus - 20! Anthony, wait a year, you're not like Howard/152f7434e0a64feb842abcac35920f34.jpg" alt="10 points 5 mistakes, plus or minus - 20! Anthony, wait a year, you&#39;re not like Howard"><br>Anthony’s first goal came from mclem, and mclem did two high-level pick-up, it is said that the second pick-up if Anthony does not open so fast, mclem can directly break into the basket to create damage, but Anthony pulled out to 45 degrees in advance, mclem ball to people, Anthony decisively hit three points! After that, batesmere’s pass, Simmons’s pass, Anthony in the first quarter 4 in 2, half 7 in 3, a total of 7 points.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/10 points 5 mistakes, plus or minus - 20! Anthony, wait a year, you're not like Howard/0537163fd5834f13b30aa69f32e48088.jpg" alt="10 points 5 mistakes, plus or minus - 20! Anthony, wait a year, you&#39;re not like Howard"><br>But to be honest, Anthony’s playing with the ball is really not a pioneer! Usually, the trailblazer has the ball in the backcourt. No matter in position attack or play tactics, other players need to open space outside to create opportunities for the two. But Anthony’s turn is slow, the rhythm is slow, and the shooting feel is not good in the second half, which is very rhythmic. The pioneer’s attack, to Anthony, a second by a second to hit, turn the pelican is a counterattack, and Anthony’s mistakes are a bit more, whether the defensive end of Williams or Hayes, are not dominant.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/10 points 5 mistakes, plus or minus - 20! Anthony, wait a year, you're not like Howard/9d31a195f20b4b72891a5fbe7a505f76.jpg" alt="10 points 5 mistakes, plus or minus - 20! Anthony, wait a year, you&#39;re not like Howard"><br>After a year’s absence from the competition, Anthony’s return to the first show should be praiseworthy. After all, there are many obstacles in the process. The Blazers need Anthony’s supplement to the front line, and Anthony also needs such a platform to prove himself again, but the start is not smooth. As always, the low hit rate, the dirty work on the defensive end, even if Anthony has the intention, he may not be able to do so well, but give more defensive pressure to Baibian, Bezier, Rabbi Sier, etc., how can it be so difficult?<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/10 points 5 mistakes, plus or minus - 20! Anthony, wait a year, you're not like Howard/fdcaecd4142a4393b946e63d84a4e4ef.jpg" alt="10 points 5 mistakes, plus or minus - 20! Anthony, wait a year, you&#39;re not like Howard"><br>Of course, the contract that the trailblazers have given Anthony is not guaranteed. It’s less than $15000 a day. Like Howard, I think about Howard’s Lakers debut. In 19 minutes, 3 points and 6 rebounds, including 3 forecourt rebounds and 2 blocked shots. Although the Lakers lost to the Clippers in the first game, Howard established his position in the Lakers: I’m a dirty and tired player, I don’t want to Ask for data! But Anthony is different!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/10 points 5 mistakes, plus or minus - 20! Anthony, wait a year, you're not like Howard/06f7a9c901e342f28a3b1cbd9edc867f.jpg" alt="10 points 5 mistakes, plus or minus - 20! Anthony, wait a year, you&#39;re not like Howard"><br>The trailblazers want Anthony to come, first of all, they value experience, second, they want him to supplement the attack firepower output of the front line. The premise is to build on the basis of high efficiency. We need to know that mclem and Lillard are both good and bad this season. The efficiency is not high. Another low efficiency Anthony, is the ball enough?<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/10 points 5 mistakes, plus or minus - 20! Anthony, wait a year, you're not like Howard/8bedc08466f84d508784e3cca6015d9d.jpg" alt="10 points 5 mistakes, plus or minus - 20! Anthony, wait a year, you&#39;re not like Howard"><br>After all, it’s just the beginning, Anthony still needs time to run in with the team, but one thing is certain, if he continues to play with such high possession and low efficiency, his marriage with the Blazers will not be too long.</p>

    <title>10 points and 11 AIDS, James With a 170 million contract in hand, he&#39;s headed for Wiggins</title>
    <url>/2019/11/23/10%20points%20and%2011%20AIDS,%20James%20With%20a%20170%20million%20contract%20in%20hand,%20he&#39;s%20headed%20for%20Wiggins/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/10 points and 11 AIDS, James With a 170 million contract in hand, he's headed for Wiggins/47a5d50d940c4e7b8d99a6721546209e.jpg" alt="10 points and 11 AIDS, James With a 170 million contract in hand, he&#39;s headed for Wiggins"><br>On the morning of November 18, in an NBA regular season, the Cavaliers met 76 people at home. After four days, they had another conversation. In the last conversation, the 76 people won 98-97 at home, one point over the Cavaliers. Harris was in a terrible state! This game is much easier, 114-95, victory over the Cavaliers! Of course, in this game, the 76ers spend three quarters on opponents, and the fourth quarter is garbage time. As the core of the team’s backcourt, Simmons gets 10 points and 11 assists. This data is OK. For Simmons, but can it meet the expectations given by the team?<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/10 points and 11 AIDS, James With a 170 million contract in hand, he's headed for Wiggins/1ee56fbce33a4602a785f1ea8bc50482.jpg" alt="10 points and 11 AIDS, James With a 170 million contract in hand, he&#39;s headed for Wiggins"><br>As the champion of 16 years, Simmons is indeed talented. He was elected the best player of the year of the American Basketball Association in college, and was selected for a while. He can play No. 3 position in college, and was placed in the position of point guard after entering the NBA. After being selected by 76 people in 16 years, he missed the whole 16-17 season because of his foot injury! On October 19, 2017, I got my NBA debut!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/10 points and 11 AIDS, James With a 170 million contract in hand, he's headed for Wiggins/bedb2d418ff04fcc9277081ae89b751c.jpg" alt="10 points and 11 AIDS, James With a 170 million contract in hand, he&#39;s headed for Wiggins"><br>In the 17-18 season, Simmons averaged 15.5 points, 8.2 assists and 8.1 rebounds, winning the NBA rookie of the year. However, in the eastern semi-final of the playoffs, the 76ers lost 4-1 to Celtic, ending their playoffs. Last season, Simmons’ data came to 16.9 + 7.7 + 8.8. In order to find a better teacher for ebbed and Simmons, the 76ers got Butler and Harris for trade, and formed their own four giants. But the 76ers were killed by Leonard in the eastern semi-final! The most impressive thing about that game was that embid was crying in the players’ tunnel!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/10 points and 11 AIDS, James With a 170 million contract in hand, he's headed for Wiggins/721f396232834b5b873ad40d43a2a9ff.jpg" alt="10 points and 11 AIDS, James With a 170 million contract in hand, he&#39;s headed for Wiggins"><br>Simmons’s first 11 games of the season were 13.7 points, 6 rebounds and 7.1 assists, even the rookie season. Of course, during this period, the off-site lace continues, which is the real meaning of Gao Fu Shuai, naturally attracting girls’ attention.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/10 points and 11 AIDS, James With a 170 million contract in hand, he's headed for Wiggins/d3446b1f09cb4e1c840926cee0347a5c.jpg" alt="10 points and 11 AIDS, James With a 170 million contract in hand, he&#39;s headed for Wiggins"><br>As we all know, Simmons’s biggest short board is the three-point goal. Like drozan, he doesn’t shoot outside. Even if the opponent directly blows him, he chooses to jump inside. This summer, Simmons worked hard for three points. According to the words of coach brown, Simmons has made great progress in the three-point line, and he is moving towards the MVP! But since the start of the new season, 0 three-point shots! Simmons has only scored three points in the preseason. It’s a zero shot! The number of shots this season is limited by too many 76ers’ end points, and he has declined, only 10.5 times, compared with 12.2 times per game in the past two years.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/10 points and 11 AIDS, James With a 170 million contract in hand, he's headed for Wiggins/328cd706e86c46d99563a84eeba6a549.jpg" alt="10 points and 11 AIDS, James With a 170 million contract in hand, he&#39;s headed for Wiggins"><br>Under this condition, Richie Paul, Simmons’ agent, won him a top salary and extended his contract ahead of time. It’s undeniable that Simmons absolutely has the capital to get the top salary in terms of physical condition and basketball intelligence. Simmons’ overall situation and playing style far exceed his age of 23, but not enough! Today, 76 people are equipped with Harris, Richardson, Ennis, kolkmaz and other shooters for Simmons and embid. Can 76 people achieve their goals this year?<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/10 points and 11 AIDS, James With a 170 million contract in hand, he's headed for Wiggins/1167ba33956d43f1a7a78d1ff8cad141.jpg" alt="10 points and 11 AIDS, James With a 170 million contract in hand, he&#39;s headed for Wiggins"><br>Simons draft period’s template is James, scoring ability is excellent, physical fitness is great, comprehensive technology, strong rebounds, wide vision, also willing to pass. But his defense is not as good as that of James at the same stage. The biggest gap between him and James lies in the influence and role on the court. That kind of domineering arrogance! Old Zhan rookie average 20.9 points + 5.5 + 5.9 data, to his third year, has risen to 31.4 + 7.0 + 6.6! But Simmons doesn’t advance, but retreats! It seems that getting a big contract at a young age is easy to move forward on the old road of Wiggins! Of course, Wiggins has not been belittled. Now Wiggins has been reborn.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>On November 20, the NBA regular season of the new season has been playing for nearly a month. Compared with last season’s chaos and hegemony, the Los Angeles Lakers have a sense of polarization this season. After a wave of seven consecutive wins, the Los Angeles Lakers have another wave of five consecutive wins. At present, they are firmly in the first place in the West. Now there are two teams that can pose a threat to the Lakers, one is Leonard and the other is leonard The Clippers led by Paojiao are led by weishao and Haden.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/100%! 99.7%! US media update the probability of Western playoffs, the Lakers ranked first, the warriors were pulled black/db52ac0176384169a686feb21c39a006.jpg" alt="100%! 99.7%! US media update the probability of Western playoffs, the Lakers ranked first, the warriors were pulled black"><br>American media “br” updated the latest Western playoff probability ranking. In this list, the Lakers are still the most domineering. They are the only team in the West that can enter the playoffs 100%!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/100%! 99.7%! US media update the probability of Western playoffs, the Lakers ranked first, the warriors were pulled black/af0cfe3797d64f74a427d9ff4cca4395.jpg" alt="100%! 99.7%! US media update the probability of Western playoffs, the Lakers ranked first, the warriors were pulled black"><br>Let’s take a look at the ranking first. The Lakers have a record of 12-2 and are expected to have a record of 44-24 in the rest of the regular season. Even if the winning rate drops, the total number of wins is expected to be about 56! The Lakers’ best record is expected to be 71-11! The Lakers have a 100% chance of entering the Western Conference playoffs! The Lakers have a 78.4% chance of reaching the division finals!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/100%! 99.7%! US media update the probability of Western playoffs, the Lakers ranked first, the warriors were pulled black/97c53b5bfaf04587b549d915441df416.jpg" alt="100%! 99.7%! US media update the probability of Western playoffs, the Lakers ranked first, the warriors were pulled black"><br>The city rivals clippers are not as fierce as the Lakers. Although Leonard and pickled peppers haven’t fit yet, in the previous game, Leonard led the team to play for a period of time alone, and Leonard has been recovering from pickled peppers, but the American media still look down on them. They think their next record is about 42-26, while the total record of clippers regular season is about 51-31 ! But clippers also basically locked in a playoff quota: 99.7%! But the probability of clippers entering the division finals is far lower than that of the Lakers, only 18.9%. Obviously, the US media see the future of the combination of the loser kapooze pepper.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/100%! 99.7%!

US media update the probability of Western playoffs, the Lakers ranked first, the warriors were pulled black"><br>The third place is the team led by Hardon and weishao. In the past two seasons, they have had the chance to bring down the warriors, but all failed. This season, they are 11-3 higher than the second place in the west, and they basically lock in a playoff place, reaching 99.7%. However, their probability of entering the regional finals is even higher than that of the Lakers, reaching 88.9%. Obviously, what the American media value is their team’s But their overall competitiveness is behind that of the Lakers and Clippers.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/100%! 99.7%!

US media update the probability of Western playoffs, the Lakers ranked first, the warriors were pulled black"><br>After that, the probability of the Suns entering the playoffs is also very high, reaching 95.9%. Although thunder is only 5-9 at present, it has pushed the Timberwolves, kings and other teams to the eighth place in the West with a 46% probability. If thunder really enters the playoffs as the eighth place in the West, it is worth looking forward to the duel between Jen and Paul.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/100%! 99.7%! US media update the probability of Western playoffs, the Lakers ranked first, the warriors were pulled black/26ac735899404d139411706aed18ca5d.jpg" alt="100%! 99.7%! US media update the probability of Western playoffs, the Lakers ranked first, the warriors were pulled black"><br>In this forecast, 13 of the 15 teams in the West have the chance to enter the playoffs, and only 2 teams have been excluded from the playoffs! One is the warriors, the other is the team the warriors beat today: Grizzlies! At present, the warriors’ record is only 3-12, ranking first from the bottom of the league. Curie will be back in next spring as soon as possible. Clyde will be reimbursed this season. Russell’s injury will stop. If green is expected to lead the team alone, the American media has given the probability of entering the playoffs in advance: 0!</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/15 points + 14 hot pot! After the 11th win of the season, the Lakers welcomed the good news, and the three big data were superior to the league/3f9a065475804ee28a85fc96b23f96d8.jpg" alt="15 points + 14 hot pot! After the 11th win of the season, the Lakers welcomed the good news, and the three big data were superior to the league"><br>In an NBA regular season game that ended at noon on November 18, the Lakers met the eagles at home. The difference of points in the first quarter of the game was completely opened. The Lakers once extended their leading edge to 30 points. Lao Ke and his daughter Gianna came to watch the game. All the stars of the Lakers naturally performed. With James helping pop to fight back and score, the game lost suspense. What else? Hey up! 122-108, the Lakers won their 11th game of the season, but there are still many things to watch through the score.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/15 points + 14 hot pot!

After the 11th win of the season, the Lakers welcomed the good news, and the three big data were superior to the league"><br>First of all, let’s talk about the three points of the Lakers. Although the Lakers have occupied the first place in the West for a long time this season, it’s hard to be flattered by their outside touch. They hit 113 three points in total, ranking 28th in the league, with a hit rate of 32.4%, far below the league average, only ranking 25th! But the hawk’s defensive strength is just like that, Lakers players are eager to play to find the outside touch! Green took the lead in the attack, hitting three three-point goals in a single quarter, while the rising old Zhan also frequently fired on the outside line. The eagles are not defensive, do not want to defend, attitude problems.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/15 points + 14 hot pot! After the 11th win of the season, the Lakers welcomed the good news, and the three big data were superior to the league/315f871c1f4a45b4b77b6addede8fb14.jpg" alt="15 points + 14 hot pot! After the 11th win of the season, the Lakers welcomed the good news, and the three big data were superior to the league"><br>With such a good chance, naturally including Rondo, Kuzma, Caruso and others, they have scored three points on the outside line, 15 out of 35 three-point goals in the whole field. I think of what old Zhan said a week ago: one day we will be able to hit 15-20 three-point goals per game! Now what the Lakers lack is confidence. In fact, the Lakers don’t lack three point shooters. Green, pop, Kuzma, Rondo, Caruso, including Daniels, all need to contribute to the team from the outside.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/15 points + 14 hot pot! After the 11th win of the season, the Lakers welcomed the good news, and the three big data were superior to the league/65a4ffe7a3ff42b39ce0ea362eed0158.jpg" alt="15 points + 14 hot pot! After the 11th win of the season, the Lakers welcomed the good news, and the three big data were superior to the league"><br>Let’s talk about the blocked cap of the Lakers. In this game, the Lakers sent out 14 hot pots in total. Although the offensive end of the bushbrow was sluggish, the whole game was 5 out of 14, but in the defensive end, Parker and hunt suffered a lot. McGee also sent out two blocked caps in the limited time, including Howard. The offensive end could not contribute, but the defense must be done in place. The volleyball big cap fan flew to the opponent’s throw, but Howard did not Change, the Lakers sit on three major internal lines to form the mobile Great Wall!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/15 points + 14 hot pot! After the 11th win of the season, the Lakers welcomed the good news, and the three big data were superior to the league/b76d5514859e44be9f8f042ce7a12ee5.jpg" alt="15 points + 14 hot pot! After the 11th win of the season, the Lakers welcomed the good news, and the three big data were superior to the league"><br>And the last good thing is Rondo. In fact, Rondo just came back in the first two games, the performance is very general, playing the sun, 2 out of 6 get 5 points 7 assists, the last game played king, 0 point 4 assists 2 mistakes, although the Lakers 11-2 record in the first place in the west, but the Lakers have a problem, the team is always prone to power failure in the third quarter. Especially when old Zhan went down to have a rest and his eyebrows were exhausted. Although the Lakers won many games without danger, it was a hidden danger after all! Rondo gave a response in this game, playing for 24 minutes, 5 out of 9, including 2-3 points and 15 points + 3 assists. On the one hand, it can give pop more rest time. The most important thing is that it can relieve the pressure on Jen. Old Zhan is strong, but he can’t control the rhythm of 48 minutes. It’s unrealistic.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/15 points + 14 hot pot! After the 11th win of the season, the Lakers welcomed the good news, and the three big data were superior to the league/c8e47d6ff40f49438570e563f6ecf3ab.jpg" alt="15 points + 14 hot pot! After the 11th win of the season, the Lakers welcomed the good news, and the three big data were superior to the league"><br>The Lakers are still at the top of the Western Conference. To be honest, the result really comes from defense. Lakers defense efficiency, the first in the league, is the only one below 100 (99.8), the second in the league with 100.6 points per game. In addition, the Lakers blocked 7.25 times per game, ranking first in the league; 53.8 points per game on the inside, ranking first in the league. Now the Lakers are one step behind: three points on the outside! Even if the three-point shooting rate of the Lakers is only the average of the league, I believe that the Lakers will lead the West for a long time and be superior to the League!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/15 points + 14 hot pot! After the 11th win of the season, the Lakers welcomed the good news, and the three big data were superior to the league/3b4f3f6451294308ac255169de4ff73a.jpg" alt="15 points + 14 hot pot! After the 11th win of the season, the Lakers welcomed the good news, and the three big data were superior to the league"><br>It’s a long season. There’s still time for the Lakers’ shooters to find their hands. Come on.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>On November 19, the NBA regular season ended at noon. The Suns played Celtic at home. Celtic won ten consecutive games in the previous game. The last game was just ended by the king, but Celtic still had to continue their journey to the West. This away game challenged the suns. Originally, it was a match worth expecting, but the suspense of the game ended early! 85-99, the Suns lost at home to Celtic. Tomorrow, the Suns will play king back-to-back. It’s too hard.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/14 points! The black horse in the West has given up the competition strategically. The first in the East has too much deterrence/a195b8af4b6a4bbca1e1509cde9516d6.jpg" alt="14 points! The black horse in the West has given up the competition strategically. The first in the East has too much deterrence"><br>Data, Celtic side, brown 14 points 9 rebounds, Tatum 26 points 11 rebounds, smart 17 points 4 assists, Walker 19 points, Wanamaker 10 points. On the sun’s side, Debray scored 15 points and 6 rebounds, Saric scored 9 points, Booker scored 20 points and 4 assists, and no one scored double.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/14 points! The black horse in the West has given up the competition strategically. The first in the East has too much deterrence/113c30cb9e3847cc9766cdc022cb2a14.jpg" alt="14 points! The black horse in the West has given up the competition strategically. The first in the East has too much deterrence"><br>In the first quarter, the break of Booker, three points of ubre, hook of Baines, Celtic of suns 8-2, then Celtic began to fight back, the break of walker, Brown’s mid shot, Tatum’s counterattack and layup, Celtic led the Suns by 4 points in the single quarter. Back in the second quarter, Kaminsky and uberlian scored 5 points, Celtic threw another three points. After the climax of the sun’s main internal line, smart and Walker scored another three points. After that, the sun’s attack stagnated. At the end of half-time, Celtic led the sun 57-42. Back in the third quarter, the sun once used Booker’s counterattack to narrow the difference to a single digit, then Walker scored points continuously, Tatum also scored three points, Tatum scored seven points in a row at the end of the quarter, and the sun was still 15 points behind.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/14 points!

The black horse in the West has given up the competition strategically. The first in the East has too much deterrence"><br>In the fourth quarter, smart also opened three points, the sun shooting feel bad, and Warner and Walker’s score to help Celtic open the difference to more than 20 points, the sun disarmed surrender, the score set at 99-85!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/14 points!

The black horse in the West has given up the competition strategically. The first in the East has too much deterrence"><br>In fact, just before the start of the game, the sun suddenly announced that Rubio’s back spasm, a direct truce! The absence of Rubio makes the sun’s offensive end chaotic. Booker is used to doing it alone. Ubre and Saric are also short of firepower support on the flank. Baines is embarrassed in the inner line. The whole sun is scattered like sand. For Celtic, they feel very common today, but they grasp the two connecting segments and rely on Walker and smart to bring out two small climaxes. Originally, the connecting segment was led by Rubio.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/14 points! The black horse in the West has given up the competition strategically. The first in the East has too much deterrence/c77cf16e39bc46a18a456ecdbffcd619.jpg" alt="14 points! The black horse in the West has given up the competition strategically. The first in the East has too much deterrence"><br>In fact, after sun got Rubio this summer, he jumped from the bottom of the former western region to become the first group of black horse. Rubio can contribute the data of 13.6 points + 8.7 assists + 6.3 rebounds per game this season. In addition, the three-point ball hit rate has reached 37.5%. This is terrible. He can not only connect the team’s attacks, but also become the end of the team. The game before sun China, in addition to a disastrous defeat of the heat, and any team to fight is not down, Rubio’s contribution is indispensable.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/14 points! The black horse in the West has given up the competition strategically. The first in the East has too much deterrence/8386c11052c6469d874eb161351ae580.jpg" alt="14 points! The black horse in the West has given up the competition strategically. The first in the East has too much deterrence"><br>At the end of the game, the Suns are 7-5, and have reached the threshold of the Western playoffs. To be sure, Rubio can’t be hurt. If the Suns are just trying to keep their strength to fight against tomorrow’s back-to-back, but if Rubio really doesn’t have a big problem, the Suns really look down on Celtic. Although Celtic’s away journey is still on the way, don’t Forget that this team has been completely reborn, Walker dare to release the ball right, smart attack break out, they are the first in the East!</p>

    <title>17 medium 6! Just had a fight with Downes! After the derby, he was torn up with jockey he cheated me</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the Philadelphia 76ers won the Nuggets 97-100. The absence of Simmons really made the 76ers unable to play the quickie attack. After all, Simmons has a first-hand organization, in addition to his excellent defense. At the end of the day, the 76ers suddenly lost power. They were hit by nuggets, a 35-13 attack wave and turned over.<br>That’s the key to the 76ers losing today. Harris + Horford + Richardson are not good at four stars. 3 of 13 in hofford and 3 of 10 in Richardson. Of course, ebbed is not much better. Today the emperor played a very inefficient game.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/17 medium 6! Just had a fight with Downes! After the derby, he was torn up with jockey he cheated me/465cb7641d4b4e4ca516448dac790c41.jpg" alt="17 medium 6! Just had a fight with Downes! After the derby, he was torn up with jockey he cheated me"><br>In the whole game, ebbed played 28 minutes with 19 points, 15 rebounds, 2 assists, 1 cover, 6 fouls and 8 mistakes. He shot six goals in 17 times and got only 19 points. In terms of the inside shooting rate, ebbed was very unqualified.<br>Of course, today’s penalty must be good for nuggets. After all, it’s their home court. But ebbed is too dependent on free throws. Today he has only seven free throws. In the previous games, the average free throw of embid was close to 10 times. The last game was 18 free throws from Sir Bobby, who scored 16 points from free throws. The shooting is almost 5 out of 16 today. But thanks to the free throw, enbid got 27 points. Today, Denver won’t give you the free throw. The emperor is a little helpless.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/17 medium 6! Just had a fight with Downes! After the derby, he was torn up with jockey he cheated me/8775a18bffbc4e6882043bfe1684c14c.jpg" alt="17 medium 6! Just had a fight with Downes! After the derby, he was torn up with jockey he cheated me"><br>The 76ers are really feeling a bit shaky now, they started strong. But recently it’s a losing streak. Today’s first three quarters 76 people how smooth wind and water. They led Denver by 19 points 84-65 at one point, but Denver went crazy at the end of the game and shot all kinds of unreasonable shots.<br>The combination of Jorge and Murray killed all sides. And at the end of the day, he didn’t let go. A jump shot is a close shot. Jokic had already passed it to his teammates, but he couldn’t finish it. The ball made a desperate attempt to run to jokki’s hand, and finally hit 2 points, which was also the destiny of the world. However, after the game, OBID was very dissatisfied with the Nuggets and thought it was the black sentry.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/17 medium 6! Just had a fight with Downes! After the derby, he was torn up with jockey he cheated me/fc44faf4f16045e6ae1c3600e37df65d.jpg" alt="17 medium 6! Just had a fight with Downes! After the derby, he was torn up with jockey he cheated me"><br>In the last 2.2 seconds, the 76ers were 1 point behind, but the nbid attack was fouled at the critical moment! Then Patton got two penalties and Denver won. Enbid was very dissatisfied. When he talked about jockey after the game, enbid tore up with him.<br>“I went to watch the replay, you know what I saw?” said enbid? I don’t have any fouls, can I be fouled? Especially in the last moment of the game, it’s just bullshit and nonsense. Nikolai yorkie is too insidious. He is cheating me! “ * *<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/17 medium 6! Just had a fight with Downes! After the derby, he was torn up with jockey he cheated me/5a7ab7169cf74f4681a55494789bd789.jpg" alt="17 medium 6! Just had a fight with Downes! After the derby, he was torn up with jockey he cheated me"><br>In the previous fight between enbid and Downes, when he talked about Downes in that game, enbid said frankly that he deliberately provoked Downes because all his actions were in his plan. In other words, ebbed’s psychological tactics against Downes won out.<br>Today, enbid thinks that he has been a general. His psychological tactics, which he was good at in the past, have been defeated by jokki.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/17 medium 6! Just had a fight with Downes! After the derby, he was torn up with jockey he cheated me/6ea7f080cf464d21a4980942355ccbaa.jpg" alt="17 medium 6! Just had a fight with Downes! After the derby, he was torn up with jockey he cheated me"><br>Just in terms of performance, Jokic is really better than enbid. He finished the semi-final jump shot in 1.2 seconds. He scored 26 points and 11 rebounds in 10 of 22 games, 6 assists, 2 steals and 2 covers. His attack efficiency is stronger than enbid.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/17 medium 6!

This time, they returned home to face the bottom Knicks in the East. In the third quarter, they were once pulled to 15 points by their opponents, so they won the game without danger. 109-104, 76 people win two in a row!

It is worth mentioning that Simmons scored his first three-point goal in his career in this game, which is gratifying.<br>In fact, in the first half, the two sides were quite glued. At the end of the second quarter, when enrid and Knicks fierce general Morris were fighting for rebounds in the under basket position, Morris pulled enrindra to the ground, enrindra got up to prepare for Morris theory, then the players and coaches of both sides quickly separated the two people, enrid turned around and left bitterly, but Morris was still reluctant to give up, It seemed that he was not afraid of the Benedict, who was bigger than him in size and height.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/17 points reversal + conflict!

The tiantuan, which competed for the title, was almost cold, but enbid was provoked by a fierce general and did not dare to resist"><br>Of course, Morris’s incessant chatter, coupled with dangerous hurtful movements, also led him to a level 1 foul. In the face of Morris’s provocation, embid did not make a rebellious response.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/17 points reversal + conflict!

The tiantuan, which competed for the title, was almost cold, but enbid was provoked by a fierce general and did not dare to resist"><br>The 76ers made a lot of moves this summer. They completed 170 million contract renewals with Simmons, 100 million dollar renewals with Horford, and 180 million top salary renewals with Harris. As the most expensive starting team in NBA history, their goal must not only be the first or second round of the playoffs, including coach brown, who also said that this year is the closest they are to the championship However, up to now, 9-5 record may be difficult to meet their expectations, after all, including raptors, heat, bucks, Celtic are much better than them.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/17 points reversal + conflict!

The Knicks’ starting five are getting better.</p>

    <title>18 points + 3 points, and 7 mistakes! The pickled peppers won&#39;t hold. It&#39;s up to Leonard</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>On November 19, a regular season NBA game ended at noon, the Clippers met thunder at home. Before the game, the Clippers official said Leonard would not play in the game, bruised his left knee, and continued the truce! Although Rivers said Leonard was close to coming back, the team didn’t want to do that. Paul faced the Clippers again, Paojiao met thunder for the first time this season, 90-88, the Clippers won two consecutive victories, but the game was definitely not easy, including Paojiao himself, this game for a long time also fell into a downturn.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/18 points + 3 points, and 7 mistakes! The pickled peppers won't hold. It's up to Leonard/ae37f8a3e05f4decae0fc157c25f9414.jpg" alt="18 points + 3 points, and 7 mistakes! The pickled peppers won&#39;t hold. It&#39;s up to Leonard"><br>In terms of data, on the clipper side, Paojiao 18 points 4 assists, zubaz 12 points 10 rebounds, Luwei 11 points 9 assists, Harrell 28 points 12 rebounds (8 front court); on the thunder side, Gary Nali 14 points, Adams 9 points 10 rebounds, Alexander 11 points, Paul 22 points 4 rebounds 4 assists.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/18 points + 3 points, and 7 mistakes!

It&#39;s up to Leonard"><br>In fact, the two sides were very glued in the first three quarters. Paojiao was limited by the single nuclear operation, and was constantly pressed by Ferguson and Gallinari. For the clippers, when the main force had only one Paojiao scoring point and was still limited, the attack end basically fell into a state of stagnation! Fortunately, in the direct conversation with Adams, Harrell nearly ran over the ball, grabbing the rebounds in the front court, and cooperating with Dewey also made the thunder exhausted. The whole game slashed 28 points, which was to help the Clippers to the end.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/18 points + 3 points, and 7 mistakes! The pickled peppers won't hold.

It&#39;s up to Leonard"><br>In fact, in the last two minutes, thunder has begun to take the lead on the scene, but it is unable to limit the cooperation between Harrell and Ludwig. Paul’s single defense of pickled peppers was successful. Then when pickled peppers chased Paul, they were stopped by Paul and chased after him. After two free throws, pickled peppers had a three-point shot. At this time, thunder’s psychological defense line collapsed, including rivers’ challenge, and the Clippers won by two points.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/18 points + 3 points, and 7 mistakes! The pickled peppers won't hold. It's up to Leonard/473b91c6917d4a369aef8d5671263d91.jpg" alt="18 points + 3 points, and 7 mistakes! The pickled peppers won&#39;t hold. It&#39;s up to Leonard"><br>Thunder lost 2 points today. To be sure, under the leadership of Paul and Gallinari, they persisted from the beginning to the end. They didn’t let up. They even had the chance to win in the last 7 seconds. At one time, the referee ruled out that hackers were fouled. Then rivers stopped. The noisy signal didn’t show that they were playing. Then they challenged the referee. The referee immediately Commuted! If Gallinari had a free throw, it could have been a different outcome.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/18 points + 3 points, and 7 mistakes! The pickled peppers won't hold. It's up to Leonard/87a997f6e1d04659a0bfa4ce4980c31c.jpg" alt="18 points + 3 points, and 7 mistakes! The pickled peppers won&#39;t hold. It&#39;s up to Leonard"><br>For Paul, he also tried his best, 22 points, 4 assists and 4 rebounds in the whole game, scoring the highest in the whole team and shooting rate in the whole team. If Paul didn’t suppress the rhythm of the game, the thunder might be played in the third quarter, but in the end, the NBA Business League, strength talks.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/18 points + 3 points, and 7 mistakes! The pickled peppers won't hold. It's up to Leonard/315dffb8909d4f18a5f834f9857360db.jpg" alt="18 points + 3 points, and 7 mistakes! The pickled peppers won&#39;t hold. It&#39;s up to Leonard"><br>Today, the clipper won by a narrow margin. It can only be said that it’s very lucky. Today, rivers clearly wants to take Paojiao as the main point of the team, but Paojiao has made too many mistakes. Maybe the old teammates know him too well, or he still hasn’t adapted to the team’s rhythm. In fact, Paojiao is best at playing without the ball, just like the last three-point shootout, he needs someone around him to stand up and attract the fire If he is really allowed to bear the responsibility of attack alone, at least at this stage is not enough.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/18 points + 3 points, and 7 mistakes! The pickled peppers won't hold. It's up to Leonard/a77da3d6aed74797983f56501d79edc2.jpg" alt="18 points + 3 points, and 7 mistakes! The pickled peppers won&#39;t hold. It&#39;s up to Leonard"><br>According to the interview before the old rivers game, Leonard and pickled peppers are likely to make the first show of the new combination in the next game against Celtic. For this clipper, it’s because of the unreasonable outburst of two substitutes, Ludwig and Harrell. The substitute of clipper decides the lower limit of the team, at least the level of the Western playoffs. But the upper limit of clipper needs to be seen from xiaoka and Paojiao Paojiao’s running in degree: three games before Paojiao’s comeback, 2-1, 84 points in three games, but it’s impossible to see his value to the team by beating the hawks and narrowly beating thunder. Let’s wait for xiaoka to return!</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In an NBA regular season game that ended on the morning of November 18, the Grizzlies met Nuggets at home. The Grizzlies didn’t do well this season, but they were also competitive under the leadership of Morant. Before the game, they ranked ninth in the West with 5-7 losses. The Nuggets had some ups and downs after winning four games in a row and lost to the eagles at home. 131-114, Denver won away games against Grizzlies, winning the sixth of nearly seven games. After that, Denver is approaching the Lakers with a record of 9-3!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/19 points! Another strong western team is approaching the Lakers.

On the Grizzlies’ side, Jackson scored 22 points and 5 rebounds, wallan 16 points and 10 rebounds, Morant 13 points and 6 assists, and Clark scored double.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/19 points!

Another strong western team is approaching the Lakers. Mr. 170 million is roaring 39 + 8 All Star"><br>In the first quarter, the Grizzlies relied on wallan to hit three points and make up the basket in a row, opening an 8-point gap. Then joaquich and Murray broke the scoring gap, and nuggets relied on the small climax at the end of the quarter to narrow the gap to 4 points. In the second quarter, the Grizzlies made a series of mistakes. Under the leadership of Gomez and pramley, Nuggets made a 15-0 climax and directly opened the gap. After the return of the main force, Murray and Millsap started to break through the pattern of continuous differentiation. In half time, Nuggets led Grizzlies 72-49. Back in the third quarter, Denver is a wave of 10-0 climax, Denver once led Grizzlies by 33%, at this time, both sides in the outer line against three points, three quarters of war, Denver 108-80 Grizzlies. At the end of the game, Nuggets sent substitutes to play, grizzlies slowly chasing points, and the final score was set at 131-114.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/19 points!

Another strong western team is approaching the Lakers. Mr. 170 million is roaring 39 + 8 All Star"><br>With the growing maturity of Murray and Jokic, Denver Nuggets have made great strides in recent seasons, from the ninth in the West in the 17-18 season, the second in the West in the regular season last year, to the top three position in the west this season. The stability of the lineup is an important factor in their rise, including the presence of Jokic in the inner line of Denver Nuggets, Murray in the outer line as the team’s pillar, and this outsourcing includes ba Dun, Millsap and Harris all have the ability of outside projection, while the healthy Nuggets also have the bench depth that many teams in the League envy. Hernan Gomez, grant, pramley and Beasley all can give the team enough firepower support. The Nuggets’ substitutes in this match roared 7-3 points, which was helped by Hernan Gomez and Porter in the second quarter The team pulled back the difference, the merit must have!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/19 points!

Another strong western team is approaching the Lakers. Mr. 170 million is roaring 39 + 8 All Star"><br>This summer, Denver Nuggets and muradar became a top salary contract of 170 million yuan in five years. After muradar came to Denver, the data has been steadily improved. Last season, he averaged 18.2 points + 4.8 assists + 4.2 rebounds. In the first 11 games of this season, the hit rate has been declining. In the last game, he had a low hand feeling of 1 out of 11. But thanks to the excellent performance of nuggets as a whole, Murray has gradually become the second leader of the team. This season, he has contributed 19.2 points + 4.8 rebounds + 4.5 assists per game. I believe that with the deepening of the season, Murray will gradually regain his touch, maintain this state and be expected to be an all star.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/19 points! Another strong western team is approaching the Lakers. Mr. 170 million is roaring 39 + 8 All Star/ed338f7c8cbe478d990ab4c369c394ae.jpg" alt="19 points! Another strong western team is approaching the Lakers. Mr. 170 million is roaring 39 + 8 All Star"><br>Of course, Denver’s biggest problem is the health of the team’s staff. In the middle of last season, only eight of them were left to play, which is really the end of the world. Can Nuggets make trouble for the Lakers and clippers with a comeback this season? At least now they are competitive. Of course, in the end, it really depends on the personal strength of the stars. In this respect, there is still a gap between nuggets and the Lakers or clippers.</p>

    <title>2-8, bottom of the League! Cole doesn&#39;t want to let it out. Green doesn&#39;t want to compromise</title>
    <url>/2019/11/10/2-8,%20bottom%20of%20the%20League!%20Cole%20doesn&#39;t%20want%20to%20let%20it%20out.%20Green%20doesn&#39;t%20want%20to%20compromise/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, Golden State Warriors lost to thunder 108-114 away. Russell tried his best in this game. He led the team with one core again in the absence of Curie + Thompson + green. Unfortunately, he was still unable to save. In 34 minutes, he made 11 of 20 shots, got 32 points, 3 rebounds, 7 assists and 2 steals.<br>Russell left in frustration after the game. He originally wanted to be the fourth in charge of warriors, but he quietly became the boss. Russell’s heart is bitter. It’s his goal to row and win the championship. Now he’s more tired than being the boss of the basketball net.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/2-8, bottom of the League! Cole doesn't want to let it out. Green doesn't want to compromise/728925ad3bb54accaa64b3da24d9f493.jpg" alt="2-8, bottom of the League! Cole doesn&#39;t want to let it out. Green doesn&#39;t want to compromise"><br>How comfortable was Russell last season? With the nets into the playoffs, their own data has also been skyrocketing, but also included in the all star. It can be said that the sun is at its zenith, and the nets are powerful. Three point King Harris outside the line hit, the inside line and Aaron the king of eating bread. On the bench there are tough players like Ding Weidi and Levere.<br>But now the warriors give Russell these three melons and two dates, to be honest, it may be the coldest start in the league. The warriors start with Russell deducted. The annual salary is less than $10 million. Which team is like this?<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/2-8, bottom of the League! Cole doesn't want to let it out. Green doesn't want to compromise/4758be135df8453da512745a875b40c2.jpg" alt="2-8, bottom of the League! Cole doesn&#39;t want to let it out. Green doesn&#39;t want to compromise"><br>According to NBA statistics, Russell has scored 30 points in three consecutive games. In terms of personal data, it should be an explosion. So far this season, Russell has scored 25 + 6 + 4 points per game, and has already scored super scorers. We don’t have to guess the purpose of warriors. In the situation that curry and Thompson can’t return this season, warriors want to put on a bad job to get a high ranking draft. Although the management didn’t say anything bad, they were honest.<br>Russell will be an important part of the warrior’s bad plan. It turns out that Russell can’t be compatible with Curie. The only way to solve this problem is to trade Russell, let him draw a good figure, and then get a usable front line. Warriors then select a new foundation for team building with high ranking draft right.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/2-8, bottom of the League! Cole doesn't want to let it out. Green doesn't want to compromise/0555034ecd9e4d9dbb7a5b3ac6c367d3.jpg" alt="2-8, bottom of the League! Cole doesn&#39;t want to let it out. Green doesn&#39;t want to compromise"><br>In this way, the warriors will be able to return to the throne next year. They will have such a lineup, 1 Curie + 2 Thompson + 3 new frontline + 4 green + 5 Rooney + Super rookie. Warrior’s plan for the next 10 years is completed. At the peak of the last 3-5 years, Curie and Thompson will continue to compete for the championship. When the three men leave, they will be able to connect seamlessly.<br>It’s just that warriors have a good appetite, but it’s not good to lose like this. According to Cole after the game, it’s best to have both fish and bear paws. Warriors lose not ugly, record and can get high ranking rookie is the best outcome.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/2-8, bottom of the League! Cole doesn't want to let it out. Green doesn't want to compromise/df9a9421340d447f9a7a0cf2a3d05617.jpg" alt="2-8, bottom of the League! Cole doesn&#39;t want to let it out. Green doesn&#39;t want to compromise"><br>Cole’s mood after the game is still quite excited, and he doesn’t hide it. Cole said: * * “our record is 2-8, now it’s the bottom of the league. I don’t think we should really accept fate, make excuses for ourselves, say that we have injuries, we are playing with two-way contract players, in order to get a lottery and so on. No, we should win some games<br>Cole spoke in such a heavy voice that he seemed to know the situation was irreversible, but he really didn’t want to see the warriors lose. If you lose a 73-9 game. That Cole really wants to be pinned on the list of historical humiliation, making people laugh for a lifetime. The warriors are likely to lose 73 games.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/2-8, bottom of the League! Cole doesn't want to let it out. Green doesn't want to compromise/ce8e1ebb4e7d4b5f86442081f2c88fe3.jpg" alt="2-8, bottom of the League! Cole doesn&#39;t want to let it out. Green doesn&#39;t want to compromise"><br>In addition, green and Cole are similar. Green is the first one who refuses to compromise when it comes to the injury of curry and whether the warriors will fall apart. Green said the warriors could make it to the playoffs, but green was lucky in the end. As soon as the front foot spoke, the ligament in the back finger was injured. Greene has gone to the hospital directly, so he doesn’t have to bear the curse of poor performance.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In an NBA regular season game that ended on the morning of November 21, the Bulls met the pistons at home. These two teams are the brothers and sisters of the East. The bulls were 5-10 and the pistons were 4-10. 109-89, the Bulls beat the pistons at home, the whole pistons, the only normal performance of Ross one, including Griffin, Johnson, Kennard and all the piston players, all failed to live up to the efforts of Ross! The pistons lost five straight games and rose did his best.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/20 points lost + to the East! 18 points, plus or minus + 5, and Ross can't bring this team/2ee36a4d8bb8419d8c6037de300d2712.jpg" alt="20 points lost + to the East! 18 points, plus or minus + 5, and Ross can&#39;t bring this team"><br>In terms of data, on the piston side, Galloway scored 13 points, Griffin scored 16 points and 8 rebounds, Zhuang Shen scored 6 points and 14 rebounds, Kennard scored 14 points, rose scored 18 points and 3 rebounds, assisted 1 stealer, and made 3 mistakes. For the bulls, Harrison has 15 points and 11 rebounds, Makanin has 24 points and 6 rebounds, Carter has 12 points and 15 rebounds, and satolanski has 15 points and 7 assists.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/20 points lost + to the East! 18 points, plus or minus + 5, and Ross can't bring this team/6c7b45d444d74949995f9aa1940ba7af.jpg" alt="20 points lost + to the East! 18 points, plus or minus + 5, and Ross can&#39;t bring this team"><br>In the first quarter, the Bulls hit a wave of 14-4 climax under the guidance of Raven and Makanin. Then the pistons relied on Griffin’s free throw and Galloway’s three-point anti super score. At the end of the quarter, rose made a long-distance counterattack and hit the layup, 30-level in a single quarter. In the second quarter, the pistons were blocked in attack, while the Bulls relied on Carter and Harrison’s advantage in the basket to continuously blow up the frame, once pulling the difference to double digits. At this time, Rose came out and made three breakthroughs in a row. He led the team to a 51 draw. Makanin led the team at the end of the festival to another climax. At the end of the half-time, the Bulls led by 4 points.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/20 points lost + to the East! 18 points, plus or minus + 5, and Ross can't bring this team/4a7b3492ec4b4a5f8c16f44465260253.jpg" alt="20 points lost + to the East! 18 points, plus or minus + 5, and Ross can&#39;t bring this team"><br>In the second half, satolanski scored two and three points to open the difference, including Griffin, Galloway and Kennard. The Bulls continued to attack the inner line. At the end of the festival, rose broke through the pull rod 2 + 1, and the bulls had a lead of 13 points. In the fourth quarter, the starting feel of the pistons was still depressed. After markanin and satolanski of the Bulls led the team to 22 points, the pistons disarmed and surrendered, and the final score was set at 109-89.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/20 points lost + to the East! 18 points, plus or minus + 5, and Ross can't bring this team/f7e813da5ce9474d9525b4fd72308160.jpg" alt="20 points lost + to the East! 18 points, plus or minus + 5, and Ross can&#39;t bring this team"><br>Today’s fiasco of pistons is not just a low hand. The five starters, Galloway 12 in 3, Griffin 15 in 4, Zhuang Shen 10 in 3, Kennard 15 in 4, have occupied a very high ball power, but the efficiency is very low! The only one that the pistons can match the bull’s rhythm is Ross. If it wasn’t for Ross to break out in the second quarter, maybe the Bulls would have pulled the difference! Most importantly, even when Ross is on the court, he is not the first attack point of the team. Kennard takes too many shots. Only when everyone is restricted can Ross try to attack.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/20 points lost + to the East! 18 points, plus or minus + 5, and Ross can't bring this team/d37c4b15028747909a0e70d44cceaed3.jpg" alt="20 points lost + to the East! 18 points, plus or minus + 5, and Ross can&#39;t bring this team"><br>Rose experienced injury before and has been out of action for 5 times. Since he came back, the last game against the Hornets, 6 out of 7 rose scored 16 points, with the highest efficiency of the whole team. In this game, he scored 18 points, with the highest score. He is also the only effective rotation player with positive efficiency of the whole team! Coach Casey has said before that the team will position rose as a substitute engine, which is similar to the role of Ludwig, but the hole dug by the main force is too big. If you give rose more time, even if you design more tactics around rose, I believe you will not lose so badly!<br>After the game, the pistons suffered five consecutive defeats, the record has become 4-10, only one game less than the Knicks, rose is trying his best, but others seem to be a joke.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, Celtic won six straight away games with a 108-87 victory over the Hornets. It has to be said that after Kyrie Owen left Celtic, the team seemed to be alive again. Major Stevens once again became a strategist. And Tatum + Hayward + Jay Brown are back to normal. Last season, smart said that the atmosphere in the dressing room was very bad, maybe the worst for Celtic in the past few years, and even affected the play of the playoffs. Everyone has become confused and now everyone is waking up.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/20+23+14! The big three have won six games in a row, Owen has been acted as soon as he left, and they have rushed to the first place/a06392956bc2475f8228ed85511f3b5a.jpg" alt="20+23+14! The big three have won six games in a row, Owen has been acted as soon as he left, and they have rushed to the first place"><br>Heywood, in particular, has exploded in the past few games, averaging 20 points per game this season and returning to his peak. It can only be said that Owen has been played again, and now Celtic have reached the first place in the East, and the whole team is very tough and hard-working. It feels like they’re back two years ago, when Celtic and Cleveland played seven games in the Eastern Conference finals, thanks to the team.<br>Today’s game also fully demonstrated the Celtic domineering spirit, from the first quarter on the Celtic 10000 arrows. Tatum holds the ball to pick the basket to hit, Heyward can not stop the continuous score to help the team keep pulling the difference. Celtic led by 10 points in the first quarter. Hayward came out 10 minutes, 8-for-6, efficient cut 14 points, 4 rebounds, 3 assists and 1 steals.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/20+23+14! The big three have won six games in a row, Owen has been acted as soon as he left, and they have rushed to the first place/0d59ab3eb85d43e6b72ad0289482d408.jpg" alt="20+23+14! The big three have won six games in a row, Owen has been acted as soon as he left, and they have rushed to the first place"><br>In the second quarter, Celtic attack did not decrease. Tatum scored two points in a row. The Hornets only relied on bridges and Zeller to maintain the difference. Good Graham came out at the critical moment to score continuously, and bacon finished the layup. The Hornets were only nine points short at half-time. Just when everyone thought the Hornets would fight back in the second half, they were hit to the sky by the Celtic attack.<br>At the beginning of the third quarter, Hayward scored four points, and Tatum and Walker continued to score. After a wave of 14-3 Celtic have achieved a 10 point advantage. Tatum and Walker still refused to let go of the Hornets, and together they scored three more points. Celtic in the third quarter has been extended to 18 points, the game was basically killed.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/20+23+14! The big three have won six games in a row, Owen has been acted as soon as he left, and they have rushed to the first place/fef3e3b3202e435da377c506641b5c48.jpg" alt="20+23+14! The big three have won six games in a row, Owen has been acted as soon as he left, and they have rushed to the first place"><br>At the end of the game, the two sides are in a deadlock. If the Hornets play 4-0 here, then the Celtics are still 4-0. The difference has been around 20 points and the game is over early. Celtic big three broke out again in the whole game, Hayward scored 20 points, 10 boards, 6 AIDS, Walker 14 points, 6 AIDS, Tatum 23 points, 9 boards. Together they scored 57 points.<br>The Hornets, bridges 16 points 8 boards, Graham 15 points 9 help, rocil was Celtic civil air defense to the explosion. In the whole game, one of rosier’s 11 points became an undercover.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/20+23+14! The big three have won six games in a row, Owen has been acted as soon as he left, and they have rushed to the first place/83a91aa031e74963bb9167e96ad2bea2.jpg" alt="20+23+14! The big three have won six games in a row, Owen has been acted as soon as he left, and they have rushed to the first place"><br>After the game, Stevens also couldn’t smile. We can’t say that Owen’s departure made Celtic normal. But their performance is different from that of last season. They are selfless in self-confidence, tacit understanding and unity. And the team doesn’t have a nominal boss.<br>But everyone seems not to want to be the boss, but to be humble to each other. It’s like in the last few games Celtic kept Tatum at the critical moment, and walker had no problem with that.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/20+23+14! The big three have won six games in a row, Owen has been acted as soon as he left, and they have rushed to the first place/f381a92c41884b21b778f9df2e65353b.jpg" alt="20+23+14! The big three have won six games in a row, Owen has been acted as soon as he left, and they have rushed to the first place"><br>This is the change of Celtic. The old know how to be a man, and the young start to be selfless. The atmosphere of the basketball net is a bit like that of Celtic last season, which gives people a rough feeling</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the Pacers beat the pistons 112-106 at home. The Pistons’ 270 million contract Trident rose + Griffin + Jackson continued to be sidelined by injury. Today is still led by Johnson Drummond. It can be said that the pistons of the new season make coach Casey shake his head and smile bitterly. They have injured too many people.<br>But in such a state, the piston is still playing brilliantly. They surround Zhuang Shen and Luke Kennard, and the pistons can still fight the walkers at both ends of the attack and defense. Especially at the end of the season, the pistons have the chance to win, but they are a little weak.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/24 + 3 and 29 + 6. Congratulations to Ross Griffin. Kathy has created another giant, double the data/1b03389f0bc2442d934527a16f4e172f.jpg" alt="24 + 3 and 29 + 6. Congratulations to Ross Griffin. Kathy has created another giant, double the data"><br>Today, the piston also showed its toughness in the process of the game. From the beginning of the first quarter, the piston has played a momentum. Big Morris raised his hand to shoot three points on the outside, Drummond made a jump shot on the inside, then hit the basket again. Snell and Kennard also contributed. Snell hit Kennard 3-pointer to 2 + 1. After Galloway came on as a substitute, he also hit three points from the outside, and the pistons made a quick attack. After the first quarter, the pistons led by 8 points, 35-27.<br>In the second quarter, the Pacers began to gain momentum. Piston’s weak second team lacked firepower and attack sharps because it wanted to fill the first place. The walkers made a straight 14-0 run over the pistons. The pistons went from eight points ahead to four points behind at half-time.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/24 + 3 and 29 + 6. Congratulations to Ross Griffin. Kathy has created another giant, double the data/b91492d8a6a64acd9e0d0a5bc9b1f1bd.jpg" alt="24 + 3 and 29 + 6. Congratulations to Ross Griffin. Kathy has created another giant, double the data"><br>In the second half, the walkers also found the offensive touch. They came up and played a wave of 15-2. The difference has been opened to 17 points. The pistons finally woke up like a dream. Under the leadership of Zhuang Shen and Morris, they also made a 7-0 hiker. Morris was the first to score 2 + 1 under the basket. But the walkers were still stronger than the pistons, who were still 13 points behind at the end of the third quarter.<br>In the last three attacks, Kennard was even more brave. Chuang Shen also frequently makes damage in the inner line. You come and I don’t give way to each other, but the difference is more beneficial to the walkers. Eventually the walker won the piston. The difference has been kept at 9 and can’t be pulled in.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/24 + 3 and 29 + 6. Congratulations to Ross Griffin. Kathy has created another giant, double the data/da25501ac8db46dfa0f99c8620c96a4b.jpg" alt="24 + 3 and 29 + 6. Congratulations to Ross Griffin. Kathy has created another giant, double the data"><br>Kennard, the piston of the whole game, is absolutely the hero of today’s piston to fight against the Pacers. He’s roaring 29 points and 6 boards. Kennard has been fantastic this season. In the past 10 regular season games, Kennard has scored 30 points once, 24 points twice and 29 points once. He has scored 77 points in the last three games.<br>So far this season, Kennard can get 18 + 4 + 3 data in 32.5 minutes per game, with a shooting rate of 45.5% and a three-point shooting rate of 42.6%. Kennard’s annual salary is only $3.83 million, with the existence of the piston bottom. But his performance has undoubtedly become the piston’s new giant. Kennad averaged only 9 + 2 games last season, doubling this season’s figures.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/24 + 3 and 29 + 6. Congratulations to Ross Griffin. Kathy has created another giant, double the data/33819e84df9a42c394b470e61d0f9cdf.jpg" alt="24 + 3 and 29 + 6. Congratulations to Ross Griffin. Kathy has created another giant, double the data"><br>In the first round of 2017, 12th ranking kennad was selected by the piston, with a height of 1.96m and a weight of 96kg. Is an outstanding guard, mainly to score, can hold the ball single or no ball. Kennard has a lot of good performances when he plays with Derek cross this season.<br>It’s good to say that Ross and Griffin are absent. The pistons have made a giant by coach Casey. In addition, Drummond also inspired an attribute, namely, passing ability. Today, Zhuang Shen scored 15 points, 13 boards and sent out 8 assists,<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/24 + 3 and 29 + 6. Congratulations to Ross Griffin. Kathy has created another giant, double the data/16dd0a7af3d04c8c99cd559e11e46359.jpg" alt="24 + 3 and 29 + 6. Congratulations to Ross Griffin. Kathy has created another giant, double the data"><br>From the piston’s point of view, as long as Griffin and Ross return, their staff can be in the East into the playoffs, Griffin will soon be back.</p>

    <title>24 for 21! Howard spoke out after the game, the Lakers still have good news, champion guard announced his comeback</title>
    <url>/2019/11/10/24%20for%2021!%20Howard%20spoke%20out%20after%20the%20game,%20the%20Lakers%20still%20have%20good%20news,%20champion%20guard%20announced%20his%20comeback/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the Los Angeles Lakers won 7 straight home games in a 95-80 win over the heat. Let’s not talk about James and Davis in this game. Let’s focus on Howard. Today, Howard is still fierce. He played for 15 minutes, shot 1 in 2, and contributed 2 points, 6 rebounds and 1 assists. Although the data looks flat, Howard’s contribution to the defensive end is visible to the naked eye.<br>Howard was also excited after the game. According to the Los Angeles reporter, Howard shouted a slogan: “I love la” when he walked into the player channel to show his loyalty to the Lakers and vent his emotions.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/24 for 21! Howard spoke out after the game, the Lakers still have good news, champion guard announced his comeback/9c81a3fe296b42d3af6e912a1eadc5de.jpg" alt="24 for 21! Howard spoke out after the game, the Lakers still have good news, champion guard announced his comeback"><br>Lakers general manager pelinka is also in the channel to meet the players. In addition, in the game, we saw Howard constantly yelling at the audience to encourage teammates. Unlike the old boy, Howard is now more rational than ever. He knows when to put away his giggling character and when to use it to give confidence to his teammates and himself.<br>There’s no doubt that the Lakers, who have won seven games in a row, are in a good environment, and Howard has set an incredible record. Howard has shot 20 out of 22 shots in the past five games, with a 90.9% hit rate. Add today’s 2 1, Howard 6 games a total of 24 shots 21. This is the highest hit rate in the league.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/24 for 21! Howard spoke out after the game, the Lakers still have good news, champion guard announced his comeback/baa9469af454497893185185237b5e35.jpg" alt="24 for 21! Howard spoke out after the game, the Lakers still have good news, champion guard announced his comeback"><br>Howard’s joining the Lakers is not only a huge promotion for him, but also a surprise for the Lakers. In the past, who can believe that Howard can play such a performance? No one would have guessed. When Howard was going to join the Lakers, many fans thought that his coming would hurt the Lakers and would not forgive him.<br>In addition, Howard’s back injury is serious, and he looks close to retirement. But Howard did seize the opportunity. He was 34 years old and woke up. A mature Howard is a treasure for the Lakers.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/24 for 21! Howard spoke out after the game, the Lakers still have good news, champion guard announced his comeback/b12e218ca774400d8b82fa9f21ed2480.jpg" alt="24 for 21! Howard spoke out after the game, the Lakers still have good news, champion guard announced his comeback"><br>In addition, James also announced a good news after today’s game. He specifically talked about the defense of the Lakers in today’s game. Especially in the fourth quarter, the Lakers restricted their opponents to only 14 points, and the heat only got 80 points. James thinks it’s incredible, because compared with last season, the Lakers’ defense improvement is terrible.<br>Another reason is that James’s groin has fully recovered. This gives James a lot of speed. James missed 27 games last season because of a groin injury.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/24 for 21! Howard spoke out after the game, the Lakers still have good news, champion guard announced his comeback/3420038ab6f647d585b67d12f6a65fac.jpg" alt="24 for 21! Howard spoke out after the game, the Lakers still have good news, champion guard announced his comeback"><br>James said: “after a summer’s recovery, my groin injury has completely healed. Now I’ve recovered my long lost speed on the court, and my physical strength has returned<br>Groin injury is not a big injury, but it is more troublesome. Because the groin connects the important part of the abdomen and thigh. Being close to little James, it is often regarded as a part of privacy. This part of the injury even the basic stretching movements are accompanied by severe pain, can only be recovered quickly through slow cultivation. When James came back last season, his groin was still torn.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/24 for 21! Howard spoke out after the game, the Lakers still have good news, champion guard announced his comeback/3a98c858332c461a9b53073bde63e02c.jpg" alt="24 for 21! Howard spoke out after the game, the Lakers still have good news, champion guard announced his comeback"><br>Finally, let’s talk about Rondo. According to Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports, Rondo has planned to have the first show of the season in the Lakers’ home game against Raptors next week. The Lakers are coming.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>On November 15, the pelicans were 132-127 at home to the Clippers in a just concluded regular season game. The pelicans were all absent from the game due to injuries. In the clippers, Cary and Beverly were also absent due to pain in their left calf. But they have George’s season debut! Paojiao 24 minutes out of the field, 17 shots 10, under 33 points 9 rebounds 4 assists! However, it was successfully captured by Holliday and fevos! Fevos cut 20 points and 20 boards, and   holiday elder brother killed red eyes! 36 points, 4 rebounds, 7 assists, 6 steals! It’s the key for the team to win by grabbing George continuously in the decisive moment!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/24 minutes under 33 + 9, George strong return!

But at the defensive end, obviously, it has not yet adapted to the rhythm and missed people for many times. In the first half, he was taken care of by his opponents and fouled four times at the end of the half. But after all, Beverly and Leonard are not here, I believe that when they come back, George’s defensive pressure will be much less. The season is still very long, the full body clippers are worth looking forward to!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/24 minutes under 33 + 9, George strong return!

<p>#Game Review<br>In the first quarter, George, who had been out of action for a long time, was targeted at the defensive end! Fevos forced George to play 2 + 1, and Holliday also used his footstep advantage to force George to lay up. On the Clippers side, McGrady scored three points on each side of the bottom corner, and Harrell also made a series of shots. The score of the two teams rose alternately! At the end of this section, George found a feeling on the offensive end! First, he hit 2 + 1, then hit 3 points at 45 ° and got 8 points in a row! At the end of the first quarter, the Clippers are 1 point ahead for the time being! Hollerdy has a hot hand this season, 4 of 5 shots, 9 points!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/24 minutes under 33 + 9, George strong return!

Holiday brother slashes 36 points, 7 helps, 6 steals successfully"><br>In the second quarter, in the third quarter of   McGrady’s bottom corner, George also made a steady four free throws, and the Clippers got a 7-point lead! Less than three minutes into the game, George was forced to take a rest after his fourth foul. Then suddenly, the pelican team blossomed at many points, a wave of 14-1 successful anti super! Holliday is more unstoppable! Three points in a row, and a breakthrough in the success of the separation of Patterson! 6 for 7 in a single quarter, 15 points and 2 assists! The pelicans fought back in the second quarter, 38-24! Half-time, 72-59, pelicans 13 points!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/24 minutes under 33 + 9, George strong return!

Holiday brother slashes 36 points, 7 helps, 6 steals successfully"><br>In the third quarter, the   clippers obviously strengthened their defensive strength and launched counterattack! George first hit the emergency stop shot, then hit 3 points at the top of the circle, leading the team to hit a wave of 11-2, reducing the difference! Then McGrady scored 6 points in a row, and Dewey hit 3 points to catch up with him. The Clippers achieved the anti super goal! At the end of this section, the two teams fell into a tug of war, and the score was tied many times! With 48.7 seconds left in the quarter, Moore’s breakthrough resulted in George’s fifth foul of the game! Section 3: the Clippers returned a wave of 38-24! At the end of the three quarters, the Clippers scored 1 point! George made 4 of 7 pitches in a single quarter and cut 12 points and 3 boards!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/24 minutes under 33 + 9, George strong return!

Moore’s 3-pointer on this side and Dewey’s 2 + 1 on that side. Hayes has been eating cakes here for 7 points! McGraw over there hit a fifth three! Seven minutes and 20 seconds before the end of the game, George came back with five fouls! Four minutes and 02 seconds before the final game, with George’s 2-Free, clippers 115-114 anti super again!

    <content><![CDATA[<p>On November 16, the Wizards beat the Timberwolves on the road. Due to the absence of Wiggins, the Wizards have a good chance to win. Bill scored 44 points, 3 rebounds and 10 assists in 15 of 22 shots, leading the wizards to a 137-116 victory. In addition to Bill’s superb form and superstar performance, substitute center Wagner has also become the X factor for the game’s wizards to win.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/25 minutes, 30 minutes, 15 rebounds, 22-year-old inner line explosion, Lakers lost another potential superstar/c5ee453c2ba94978ba4bbfa364b3a398.jpg" alt="25 minutes, 30 minutes, 15 rebounds, 22-year-old inner line explosion, Lakers lost another potential superstar"><br>Wagner has a very good rebounding ability and relatively stable shooting ability. At the beginning of the first quarter, Wagner shot inside and outside, both inside the layup and corner three points, 5 points and 2 boards in a single quarter. The next season, he also easily scored under the basket, or dunked well, and hit three points at the top of the arc, then scored 7 points and 1 board.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/25 minutes, 30 minutes, 15 rebounds, 22-year-old inner line explosion, Lakers lost another potential superstar/5314f2fb62454fb08eb141b72368a07c.jpg" alt="25 minutes, 30 minutes, 15 rebounds, 22-year-old inner line explosion, Lakers lost another potential superstar"><br>In the second half, Wagner was more brave. In the third quarter, he scored three points again. At the end of the third quarter, he did whatever he wanted under the basket. In the single quarter, Wagner made 7 of 8 shots, scored 15 points, 10 boards, 1 assists and 1 steals. Although the last quarter is more like the dominance of garbage time, Wagner’s brilliant performance is quite gratifying.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/25 minutes, 30 minutes, 15 rebounds, 22-year-old inner line explosion, Lakers lost another potential superstar/a4461188e23c48da96d4a8a3c5fa2d5c.jpg" alt="25 minutes, 30 minutes, 15 rebounds, 22-year-old inner line explosion, Lakers lost another potential superstar"><br>In the whole game, Wagner scored 30 points, 15 boards, 2 assists and 1 steals in 13 of 15 shots, 4 of 3 goals, both of which set career highs. Wagner is the 25th player selected by the Lakers in the first round of 2018. In the three-point trade of brother bushmei this summer, Wagner was sent to the Wizards as a trade addition.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/25 minutes, 30 minutes, 15 rebounds, 22-year-old inner line explosion, Lakers lost another potential superstar/b5c0e7fee6dd483fa90d4a6d16a140ae.jpg" alt="25 minutes, 30 minutes, 15 rebounds, 22-year-old inner line explosion, Lakers lost another potential superstar"><br>​<br>However, like Thomas Bryant before him, Wagner has found his own growth opportunities in the weak Eastern team. In the new season, Wagner has played only 10 games, scoring double in seven times, and the average score has increased from 4.8 points and 2 boards last season to 12.8 points and 5.9 boards now. You know, he only played 18.5 minutes per game, shooting 63.2% and shooting 47.8%.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/25 minutes, 30 minutes, 15 rebounds, 22-year-old inner line explosion, Lakers lost another potential superstar/8be319a5b3d34588a9560f593369980c.jpg" alt="25 minutes, 30 minutes, 15 rebounds, 22-year-old inner line explosion, Lakers lost another potential superstar"><br>The Lakers gave up some of their young talents in building their current super lineup. Maybe in the end, it’s not that these talents are not as good as expected, but that the Lakers can’t wait, they don’t have time to wait for the growth of young people, so that these players become the passers-by in the team’s history. Russell, Ingram, Wagner, they are not unfit for the Lakers, just meet at the wrong time.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the pelican beat the Hornets 115-110 away to win again. In this game, gerbauer missed the game, while Redick started. It has to be said that the NBA is still attacking and winning. Today, after Redick started, it is obvious that Pelican firepower increased greatly. Redick scored 22 points in the whole game and gave Ingram full support on the offensive side. Today’s Ingram is still the pelican’s thigh. He has 25 points, 9 boards and 4 assists in 8 of 12 games, including a three point kill in the last moment of the last quarter. In addition, hollerdy also carried the team at both ends of the attack and defense, although only 10 points, but hollerdy sent 11 assists.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/25+22+12!

The Lakers sniggered. Bauer is not as good as Reddick"><br>The pelican also played very hard today. From the first quarter, the pelican’s firepower was good. Hollerdy broke the layup and Ingram scored three points. Pelican 5-0 start, Redick is even three points in a row. But then the Hornets erupted, rookie PJ Washington scored in a row. Pelicans lead 33-28 in the first quarter.<br>The second quarter of the hornet’s bench began to break out, Meng Keyong can not be. The Hornets made a 13-0 start against the pelicans. Pelican responded by Ingram scoring 2 + 1. Redick also scored three points, half-time Pelican catch 55-61 only 6 points.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/25+22+12!

The Lakers sniggered. Bauer is not as good as Reddick"><br>In the second half, Rozier was very fierce at the beginning of the game. He raised his hand to shoot three points when holding the ball on the outside line. The Hornets once led by nine points. But the pelican finally opened the outside handle. Redick and Williams kept scoring, and Holliday hit from mid range. The pelicans kept biting the Hornets and they were still five points behind in the third quarter.<br>At the end of the season, Ingram broke out. He first sent assists to his teammates, and then he scored 2 points in the fast break. The pelican quickly equalized the difference. Redick also became Ingram’s assistant, and his hollerdy teamed up to support INGO. The pelican completed the anti super. Ingram is also in attack mode, scoring five points in a row. The pelican made a wave of 10-0 kills. Although the Hornets keep chasing points, Ingram killed the game with three more points in the last minute.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/25+22+12! Ingram lost three points in the last quarter. The Lakers sniggered. Bauer is not as good as Reddick/4b3548dc17264823a3fe50f257b85bd4.jpg" alt="25+22+12! Ingram lost three points in the last quarter. The Lakers sniggered. Bauer is not as good as Reddick"><br>The pelican Trident cut down 25 + 22 + 12 data in the whole game. In general, Bauer’s bonus for the pelican is not as good as a Redick. Looking at the 76ers, we all know that Simmons is excellent, but he has no long-range shooting ability, no excellent offensive firepower. It’s a serious drag on the 76ers’ attack. Last season, the 76ers played six games against the Raptors.<br>If Simmons had the ability to make long-range shots like Redick, maybe the 76ers could have crossed the Raptors and won the title last season. So we used to say that Bauer’s upper limit was Rondo, and Simmons was LeBron James with no projection ability.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/25+22+12! Ingram lost three points in the last quarter. The Lakers sniggered. Bauer is not as good as Reddick/f19467160715481c894cf120f070e103.jpg" alt="25+22+12! Ingram lost three points in the last quarter. The Lakers sniggered. Bauer is not as good as Reddick"><br>It’s true that pelicans don’t really want Ingram in this summer’s trade. Instead, he wants Kuzma, and Bauer is a player the pelican calls for. But from a practical point of view, Ingram is playing instead. He became a scorer with an average of 26 points and a young Durant.<br>But Bauer does not have the outside attack firepower, does not have the ball single ability, instead the upper limit is not high, the practical effect is not as good as a Redick, at least Redick has the attack, can share the pressure to Ingram. Besides, Kingley said Ingram was not the leader, but Zion the Glassman?<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/25+22+12! Ingram lost three points in the last quarter. The Lakers sniggered. Bauer is not as good as Reddick/442aae48a2954505815f3acb647f0340.jpg" alt="25+22+12! Ingram lost three points in the last quarter. The Lakers sniggered. Bauer is not as good as Reddick"><br>Davis left the pelican this season, and the Lakers became the new team leader. But Ingram pelicans must have made money. Hart and Bauer have become gifts. The Lakers can laugh. They basically traded Ingram for Davis, who is definitely blood earned, and the draft right is not worth the money.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>At noon on November 16, thunder played against 76 people at home. According to the strength of both sides, there was no suspense in the game. 76 people gathered here to start the best five tigers, but lost! 127-119, thunder defeated the league’s most expensive starter under Paul’s leadership. Obviously, Paul can afford 40 million yuan today, but thunder is not easy to deal with!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/27 + 8, Paul tear off the veil! The most expensive group in the League was defeated in 7 wars and 5 defeats. They spent money to make jokes/a55fabd1b2dd4044970d379969097c5c.jpg" alt="27 + 8, Paul tear off the veil! The most expensive group in the League was defeated in 7 wars and 5 defeats. They spent money to make jokes"><br>In terms of data, the thunder side, Gallinari 28 points 7 rebounds, Ferguson 19 points, Alexander 24 points, Paul 27 points 8 rebounds 5 assists, 0 mistakes, plus or minus value + 16, 12 free throws in all. For the 76ers, Harris has 21 points and 6 rebounds, hofford has 12 points and 5 assists, nbid has 31 points and 12 rebounds, Richardson has 28 points and Simmons has 16 points and 11 rebounds and 8 assists.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/27 + 8, Paul tear off the veil!

The most expensive group in the League was defeated in 7 wars and 5 defeats. They spent money to make jokes"><br>In the first half, the two sides each played a good game. In the first quarter, embid and Harris opened the gap continuously. Then Gallinari responded. After that, the two sides kept about 10 points. Ferguson and nedel had a small climax at the end of the quarter, with 76 people in a single quarter leading by 5 points. In the second quarter, nbid was able to score three points, but thunder, under the leadership of Gallinari and Paul, continued to make damage under the assault basket, while the 76ers once fell into a scoring shortage, with thunder exceeding 5 points in half-time. At the beginning of the third quarter, thunder kept the leading position, and then hofford and Scott scored three points in a row. The inner line of nbid scored in a row, and the 76ers scored three points again.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/27 + 8, Paul tear off the veil!

The most expensive group in the League was defeated in 7 wars and 5 defeats. They spent money to make jokes"><br>The most critical fourth world, Paul’s retreat, Paul’s breakthrough, Paul’s free throw, thunder and the score of 76 people have always been intertwined. At the last moment, neither enbid nor Paul’s mid shot killed the game, 107, overtime! After entering extra time, Ferguson’s three points, Alexander’s breakthrough, and then Gary Nali and Alexander Dalian scored 7 points, the game ended, thunder 127-119 defeated 76 people!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/27 + 8, Paul tear off the veil!

The most expensive group in the League was defeated in 7 wars and 5 defeats. They spent money to make jokes"><br>The most embarrassing point of this game is here. The 76ers start with five tigers. Everyone’s performance is very good, and the data is also normal, including Harris’s three points, ebbed’s three points, Richardson’s breakthrough, Simmons’s breakthrough, no abnormal players, but still lose! On the one hand, the backup team is really weak. On the other hand, thunder really relies on Paul! Paul scored 16 points in the fourth quarter and extra time. Under his tandem, Gallinari had more room to break through. Ferguson also had a vacancy to hit three points. Paul’s attraction to the other side also made Alexander more relaxed.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/27 + 8, Paul tear off the veil! The most expensive group in the League was defeated in 7 wars and 5 defeats. They spent money to make jokes/31130f5e90e2406d985e822c5a82a6a9.jpg" alt="27 + 8, Paul tear off the veil! The most expensive group in the League was defeated in 7 wars and 5 defeats. They spent money to make jokes"><br>The 76ers are really helpless. This summer, they have the biggest action. They shocked the league by giving Harris a contract of 180 million yuan in five years, reached a contract extension of 170 million yuan in five years with Simmons, and then signed hofford with 109 million yuan in four years, plus the contract of 148 million yuan with enbid, and the contract of 42 million yuan with Richardson. Their goal in the new season is very clear, that is, to fight for the championship and to sit on the most expensive starting line in history Tiantuan, then just to reach the eastern semi-finals or the eastern finals, is definitely unacceptable!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/27 + 8, Paul tear off the veil! The most expensive group in the League was defeated in 7 wars and 5 defeats. They spent money to make jokes/5ecd692a1afa45ac97ccb8cd2bf05d4d.jpg" alt="27 + 8, Paul tear off the veil! The most expensive group in the League was defeated in 7 wars and 5 defeats. They spent money to make jokes"><br>But in the past three games, the 76ers were very depressed. One point narrowly beat the Cavaliers. Thanks to the sudden power failure of the Cavaliers at the last moment, it was followed by the complete defeat of magic. Today, they lost the thunder again. Considering this game, the 76ers lost 5 games in nearly 7 games, falling from the first straight line in the east to the fifth in the East! And the most terrible thing is that they are very normal today! Can’t even fight the thunder?</p>

    <title>27+7+7! East chip won James in one game, Carlisle also showed his cards, Wei Shao is in danger</title>
    <url>/2019/11/10/27+7+7!%20East%20chip%20won%20James%20in%20one%20game,%20Carlisle%20also%20showed%20his%20cards,%20Wei%20Shao%20is%20in%20danger/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>At the end of today’s game, lone ranger won 107-106 at home! It’s harder to win than the lone Rangers, no matter what the process is, but they won at least. Today’s protagonist is undoubtedly Luka Dongqi, who scored only 6 points in the first half. However, in the second half, dongqiqi scored 21 points, and in the whole game, 10 of dongqiqi scored 27 points, 7 boards and 7 AIDS. It’s worth mentioning that East Church won LeBron James in one game.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/27+7+7! East chip won James in one game, Carlisle also showed his cards, Wei Shao is in danger/c176c2a2151f4d58a8e31e82377c8dec.jpg" alt="27+7+7! East chip won James in one game, Carlisle also showed his cards, Wei Shao is in danger"><br>According to NBA statistics, LeBron James’s career average is 27 + 7 + 7, but it’s amazing that old Zhan hasn’t won 27 + 7 + 7 in any game in his career, and now he has been achieved by Dongqi. It can only be said that the scepter of the first player in the League will be handed over. After James gradually ages, dongqiqi will undoubtedly have a chance to attack the first player in the league.<br>Because of the excellent relationship between dongqiqi and James, in the previous Lakers’ victory over lone Rangers, dongqiqi said that he had been a James fan since he was a James iron fan who regarded him as his idol. From the style of playing in Dongqi, though different from James. But there was a real James presence in East Church’s passing.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/27+7+7! East chip won James in one game, Carlisle also showed his cards, Wei Shao is in danger/5fab1be6204d472aa4547dfdcbfc80a4.jpg" alt="27+7+7! East chip won James in one game, Carlisle also showed his cards, Wei Shao is in danger"><br>It’s worth mentioning that former NBA coach George Carr talked about Luca Dongqi on a show in the United States. George Carr thinks that dongqiqi feels like a young magician Johnson. Although he is a young man, dongqiqi doesn’t play like a young man at all. He is like a veteran who has played for more than ten years. James was once described as playing like a magician.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/27+7+7! East chip won James in one game, Carlisle also showed his cards, Wei Shao is in danger/91fc18ef12a94a039af17bea2d24af5c.jpg" alt="27+7+7! East chip won James in one game, Carlisle also showed his cards, Wei Shao is in danger"><br>Carr said: “Dongqi is a real young player, but I really can’t say he is a young man. Because he reminds me of Magic Johnson when he was young. It’s just that the magician shot the ball in general, and Dongqi shot very well. He has the skill and talent of a magician as well as the figure. The lone ranger player wants him to hold the ball because he can create opportunities for them, as well as Dongqi’s courage. He has the courage to take responsibility at the critical moment. It would be amazing if he could help Dongqi make it to the playoffs this year! “<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/27+7+7! East chip won James in one game, Carlisle also showed his cards, Wei Shao is in danger/126677af60b747368800f3e297a3b9a0.jpg" alt="27+7+7! East chip won James in one game, Carlisle also showed his cards, Wei Shao is in danger"><br>In fact, in last season, Dongqi’s rookie season almost led the team into the playoffs, but at that time, lone ranger started very strong. But after that, the team is ready to completely rebuild around East Church. The players who are not suitable for Dongqi and the players who are against Dongqi will be traded. So Jordan and Barnes and a group of core players all left the team.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/27+7+7! East chip won James in one game, Carlisle also showed his cards, Wei Shao is in danger/9182b11035f5413483bfeb89c95fd922.jpg" alt="27+7+7! East chip won James in one game, Carlisle also showed his cards, Wei Shao is in danger"><br>This season the lone ranger is a team built entirely around East chip, plus portzingis’s return. Lone ranger has scored 5-2 in the West. Carlisle was hiding last season, and this season he’s completely showdown. After today’s game, Carlisle talked about whether Dongqi can average 3 pairs per game.<br>Carlisle is very satisfied with his students and confident, Carlisle said: “in my eyes, Dongqi is one of the best players on the planet, and I will not be surprised by anything he does, whether it’s three pairs or anything.”<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/27+7+7! East chip won James in one game, Carlisle also showed his cards, Wei Shao is in danger/a605882930784aed8613e7895ca86fcd.jpg" alt="27+7+7! East chip won James in one game, Carlisle also showed his cards, Wei Shao is in danger"><br>There’s no doubt it’s dangerous for Westbrook’s three double record. Because so far this season, Dongqi can contribute 26.7 points, 10.3 rebounds, 9.5 assists and 1.5 steals. If dongqiqi continues to play like this, it should be OK to average three doubles per game.</p>

Leading the team forward is the most important thing. Zhan, 35, was absent from the game last season due to a long time of injury and the team’s poor performance, which led to him not even entering the top ten in the MVP selection, and also caused many media doubts that James was really old.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/29.9%!

    <title>3 in 13, plus or minus - 15! Morant also hit the rookie wall, and fultz began to cash in on his talent</title>
    <url>/2019/11/10/3%20in%2013,%20plus%20or%20minus%20-%2015!%20Morant%20also%20hit%20the%20rookie%20wall,%20and%20fultz%20began%20to%20cash%20in%20on%20his%20talent/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, magic beat Grizzlies 118-86 at home. Morant seems to have hit the rookie wall this year. In the whole game, Morant scored only 8 points in 3 of 13, with a positive and negative value of - 15. Although in terms of organization, Morant is excellent, but after the offensive end was targeted, Morant also lost a bit of edge. After all, this is the rookie, their playing method is relatively new at the beginning, but once the opponent makes some targeted deployment, these rookies start to not adapt. This is the rookie wall, and Morant also started to hit the rookie wall.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/3 in 13, plus or minus - 15! Morant also hit the rookie wall, and fultz began to cash in on his talent/250241f081b24199835717822056bbc1.jpg" alt="3 in 13, plus or minus - 15! Morant also hit the rookie wall, and fultz began to cash in on his talent"><br>According to NBA statistics, before Morant’s game. He averaged 52.3% in seven games, getting 20.4 points, 3.7 rebounds and 5.3 assists. It became the first new player to get 20 points and 5 assists per game in seven games after Michael Jordan in 1984-1985.<br>So Morant should be studied. Today, Morant is very successful in defending magic. He grabbed Morant’s legs and slowed down his breakthrough speed. On the outside defense, I don’t pay attention to him as I did in the past, but choose the close side. In addition, the magic is really good today.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/3 in 13, plus or minus - 15! Morant also hit the rookie wall, and fultz began to cash in on his talent/92e7ca8982fd4d9e9d32ca4b0209c196.jpg" alt="3 in 13, plus or minus - 15! Morant also hit the rookie wall, and fultz began to cash in on his talent"><br>From the beginning of the first quarter, magic will be launched. Isaac’s start is a quick break, vuchevic also catches a three-point in the outside line, and Funiya has a big change in holding the ball, playing a strong 2 + 1. Bamba also finished eating pancakes in the air, and then made up the basket. Magic led by 12% in the first quarter. Morant feels cold.<br>In the second quarter, Morant finally scored a landmark 2 points in a round, and the two sides also fell into a tug of war. This way, he played 2 + 1 under the basket and hit three points on the outside line. On this side, Augustine and vucevic have their own CIC responses. The magic led by three points at half-time, 51-48.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/3 in 13, plus or minus - 15! Morant also hit the rookie wall, and fultz began to cash in on his talent/8fd2cba53c77429fa90b28f1b446e5ce.jpg" alt="3 in 13, plus or minus - 15! Morant also hit the rookie wall, and fultz began to cash in on his talent"><br>In the second half, top scorer Rafael fultz began to shine. He faced defenders in an attack round. A big change of holding the ball, a slight acceleration to break through the basket to score 2 points. The goal highlighted fultz’s physical talent, in addition to fultz also showed his talent on the defensive end. It’s amazing that he can bounce twice. If he didn’t get a strange disease, he would forget how to shoot. To fultz in the University’s shooting hand, and the way to shoot.<br>Coupled with his physical explosive power, he is the next derrickross, which is a pity.

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the Pacers took the Wizards 121-106 at home. The Wizards only had a half-time stalemate with the walkers. They were beaten in the third quarter, and today Japan’s eight demon stars are not performing well. He played 21 minutes, 5-for-0, no points, only 8 rebounds and 1 assists, plus or minus the lowest - 19. It’s probably the worst game he’s played since he was chosen by the Wizards. Although he played a role in rebounding, he lost himself on the offensive side. Of course, it also has something to do with the ball right. Today, eight villages won’t get many mobile phones.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/30+20+15! In the worst battle of the eight villages, Bryant tried his best, and bill was blinded/6eb4a8f4123a464687a7fa29558ef827.jpg" alt="30+20+15! In the worst battle of the eight villages, Bryant tried his best, and bill was blinded"><br>In the process of the game, the walkers also went with the wind and the water. From the beginning of the first quarter, sabonis kept scoring under the basket, and Warren was even more brave than three points in a row. The Wizards responded with three points from Thomas Jr. and then Bill and Bryant hit two points respectively. First quarter wizards and walkers tied for 26-26.<br>In the second quarter, the walkers began to attack. Bitadze hit three points, McDermott hit three points, and Holliday hit three points. The walkers began to rain a wave of three points. Then McDermott broke out again. He hit three consecutive three points and scored four three points in a single quarter. Walkers scored 44 points in a single quarter, while wizards scored 36. At half-time the Pacers had already taken the lead by eight points.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/30+20+15!

In the worst battle of the eight villages, Bryant tried his best, and bill was blinded"><br>Bill did his best in the first half. In 20 minutes, he made 8 of 13 free throws, 4 of 4 free throws and scored 21 points, 1 rebounds and 1 assists. Unfortunately, Bill didn’t feel good in the second half. After 13-8, he made 4 of 16 and made 12 of 29. In the second half, bill became the king of free throws and was shot in the eye.<br>Because in the second half the pacer hit a wave of 21-2 to spread the difference to 24 points. The more anxious bill is, the less he can get in. In the end, the wizard came to the end with 14 points. It’s a pity that although the fourth quarter wizards worked hard, they couldn’t pull in the difference, and they have been hovering around 10 points.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/30+20+15!

In the worst battle of the eight villages, Bryant tried his best, and bill was blinded"><br>Bill got 30 points, 5 rebounds, 5 assists, 29 of 12. Bryant scored 20 points and 11 rebounds, shooting 6 out of 10 and 7 out of 7 free throws. This Lakers old will still be fierce, can only say that dare to call Bryant is really not a fuel-efficient lamp.<br>In addition, the wizard’s little Thomas scored 10 points, but his hand feeling was not good, 3 out of 10, and the positive and negative values were almost - 16 compared with those of the eight villages. Old Raptors will be a big outbreak of miles, he cut 15 points, plus and minus only a positive + 10 wizards player.<br>The wizard’s trident today is Bill + Bryant + miles, with 30 + 20 + 15 respectively.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/30+20+15!

Seven of the walkers scored double in the game, and it looks like they are in the right place. Although orladibo has not yet returned, the walkers still made a mercury rush attack.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/30+20+15!

In the worst battle of the eight villages, Bryant tried his best, and bill was blinded"><br>Brogden in particular, this summer the walker can get him from the bucks. It’s really blood earned. He’s great. When the king of oradibo returns, the walker will become a strong force in the East.</p>

It’s too slow to retreat. Grizzly got nearly 140 points. I need to do better, I’m still not focused on the defensive side. Today, the coach told me to play my own style, attack the basket and keep aggressive. I think I’m comfortable as the initiator of the attack. But defense needs to be strengthened. “<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/30+25+13! After two consecutive defeats, he fell out of the top eight.

It depends on whether he wants to have surgery or not. The Celtic team can support him to come back if he is slow.</p>

Spread the difference to 11 in the half.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/34+34+20! Hallelujah did his best, the letter brother looked dignified, and Leonard became the big winner/383ef8a6c3014b75bcb352a1d26a8673.jpg" alt="34+34+20! Hallelujah did his best, the letter brother looked dignified, and Leonard became the big winner"><br>In the first half, the Clippers only relied on the two players of Ludwig and Harrell to survive. Ludwig and Harrell scored 34 points in half. Lu Wei got 18 points, 4 rebounds and 5 assists; Harrell got 16 points, 4 rebounds and 3 assists from 7 of 10 shots. In the second half, the clippers were still attacked by the two men. As soon as Harrell started, he kept chasing points under the basket. Beverly hit three points again. The Clippers reduced 11 points to three points at one time.<br>But hill of bucks came out again. He scored three more points with brother Xuebu, while the clipper only relied on Luwei to maintain the difference. At the end of the third quarter, the clippers were nine points behind again.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/34+34+20! Hallelujah did his best, the letter brother looked dignified, and Leonard became the big winner/665555a8e20e41d8a312bb229bc97bf5.jpg" alt="34+34+20! Hallelujah did his best, the letter brother looked dignified, and Leonard became the big winner"><br>At the end of the period, the two sides fell into a deadlock. Zubates and Ludwig scored continuously here, while Beverly scored 2 + 1. Over there hill and Lopez Kovar and other fierce players also constantly score in response. The Bucks continued to dominate, with alphabet brother scoring seven points in a row. He hit three points first, then lay up and dunk. At one point, the Bucks were 14 points ahead in the last four minutes.<br>It’s a pity that the Clippers are still tough. Shamet starts to change into T-Mac. He scores three points in all kinds of difficulties. Harrell and Ludwig have also scored five points in a joint effort. The Clippers are closing the gap to five. In the last minute, when shamet was still a big step away from the three-point line, he raised his hand and shot three points, and hit the board magically. Unfortunately, the Bucks’ free throw was too steady at the last minute, so the Clippers could only swallow the loss.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/34+34+20! Hallelujah did his best, the letter brother looked dignified, and Leonard became the big winner/68833c32210b4146a9910d73748a58b8.jpg" alt="34+34+20! Hallelujah did his best, the letter brother looked dignified, and Leonard became the big winner"><br>In the whole game, the Clippers lost their Trident. Harrell scored 34 points and 12 rebounds, Luwei 34 points and 6 rebounds, 11 assists, Beverly 20 points and 10 rebounds. The Clippers picked up the missing seats of Leonard and George last season. In addition, shamet also got 14 points and almost became a sharp weapon for the Clippers to overturn.<br>After the game, Harrell was also depressed to leave, and Luwei had no choice but to show his hands. There’s no way today if there’s Leonard, the clippers can win, they’re just short of a tranquilizer needle.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/34+34+20! Hallelujah did his best, the letter brother looked dignified, and Leonard became the big winner/1c19866ed4a9497699f5ba3e60aebf12.jpg" alt="34+34+20! Hallelujah did his best, the letter brother looked dignified, and Leonard became the big winner"><br>Bucks letter brother got 38 points, 16 rebounds, 9 assists, 2 steals and 2 blocks, but after the game letter brother’s expression is very dignified, he won more than lost. Because the bucks are still playing such a thrilling game when their opponents have given way to two superstars.<br>It’s reminiscent of last season’s series in which the Bucks won four sets in a row, leading the Raptors 2-0, and Leonard became a nightmare for Letterman. Leonard didn’t show up today, but his clipper still scared the alphabet. Leonard was right to join the clipper</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the Raptors narrowly beat the kings 124-120 at home. After this game, the king has 8 games in the new season, with a record of 2-6. There is no doubt that the king’s performance can not meet the expectations of the outside world. When Joel was manager last season, Dalglish almost made it to the top eight in the West. This season, King has become a fish belly under the leadership of new coach Walton. Watching the Lakers win the first place in the west, Walton doesn’t feel like it.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/4-1, 5 points, plus or minus - 11. Congratulations to the Lakers for avoiding the disaster and saving another 25 million/5cd9639219a644d3a6ee9bb5c94a6652.jpg" alt="4-1, 5 points, plus or minus - 11. Congratulations to the Lakers for avoiding the disaster and saving another 25 million"><br>Of course, the king’s attack has improved today. Their three giants Hilde + Barnes + Fox have contributed 26 + 21 + 17 in the face of raptors. Barnes scored 26 points, fox 17 points, 7 rebounds, 9 assists and Hilde 21 points. In addition, the sixth substitute Bogdan Bogdanovic scored 22 points.<br>But the Raptors were too strong, even without Leonard. But we all know that the Raptors are a team with a lower limit. With Leonard they are champions and without Leonard in the East they are in the top four. Today’s game really shows that, the first time the Raptors were fired.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/4-1, 5 points, plus or minus - 11. Congratulations to the Lakers for avoiding the disaster and saving another 25 million/e5c405df8d404a51939d5c1a399c75e9.jpg" alt="4-1, 5 points, plus or minus - 11. Congratulations to the Lakers for avoiding the disaster and saving another 25 million"><br>At the beginning, Hilde and fox scored three points each, Barnes also shot from the outside. The Raptors are not willing to be outdone. Van Jordan + anunoby + Lori + Pau Gasol also hit three points each. The Raptors are more powerful. And raptors will not only three points, their internal advantage against the king is also displayed incisively and vividly. In the first quarter, raptors led the king by 36-23 points.<br>In the second quarter, the Raptors continued to attack, Powell hit in the middle distance, and Ibaka scored 2 points with the ball inside. Raptor will continue to pull the difference. The king finally woke up in a dream. Ariza came out and hit three points, the first and last goal of his game. Because Ariza never hit again. The Raptors still led 66-58 at half-time.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/4-1, 5 points, plus or minus - 11. Congratulations to the Lakers for avoiding the disaster and saving another 25 million/b3e47a18e2b9486a877a6a0909b7e71a.jpg" alt="4-1, 5 points, plus or minus - 11. Congratulations to the Lakers for avoiding the disaster and saving another 25 million"><br>In the second half, the two sides fell into a tug of war. Anunobi on this side scored three points, and Hilde on the other side also shot in. Hild layup and sikam play 2 + 1. Damon hit three points, Fox also broke through the scoring, three quarters after the Raptors or leading 7 points. In the last two minutes of the last quarter, the king was eight points behind, and they finally started the counterattack. Bergdan and Barnes made the difference close to four points in a row. It’s a pity that Hilde’s hand is soft at the critical moment. He bounced out of the box in the middle distance and the king regretted losing the game.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/4-1, 5 points, plus or minus - 11. Congratulations to the Lakers for avoiding the disaster and saving another 25 million/0506aa4cc007444ba117fd4d1a86c94a.jpg" alt="4-1, 5 points, plus or minus - 11. Congratulations to the Lakers for avoiding the disaster and saving another 25 million"><br>Walton shook his head after the game and left in dismay. In terms of Kenny Dalglish’s current strength, it’s hard for them to reach the playoffs in the West. In addition, the veteran of the team is a little behind, especially Ariza. Kenny Dalglish signed Lakers veteran Trevor Ariza for $25 million in two years this summer, and his contract expires in 2021. Ariza is the king’s third highest salary, $12.19 million a year.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/4-1, 5 points, plus or minus - 11. Congratulations to the Lakers for avoiding the disaster and saving another 25 million/ac12ae84a49c4a38a2006891d81112c4.jpg" alt="4-1, 5 points, plus or minus - 11. Congratulations to the Lakers for avoiding the disaster and saving another 25 million"><br>But Ariza’s performance today was frustrating. He scored 5 points and 5 boards in 1 out of 18 minutes and 4, with a positive and negative value of - 11. That is to say, when Ariza is present, the king loses 11 points. The 34 year old striker looks really old. Ariza, 33, averaged 14 + 5 + 3 in the Wizards last season. This season, under Walton’s guidance, Ariza has gradually become a marginal figure.<br>Average 23 minutes of the field only get 4 + 4 data, hit rate is only 31.2%. The data is a big drop. People say that time is a butcher’s knife. But Walton seems to have become a player’s butcher’s knife. This season’s figures for Hilde and fox are down from last season.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/4-1, 5 points, plus or minus - 11. Congratulations to the Lakers for avoiding the disaster and saving another 25 million/cc1ce639396e47c68be195946062205d.jpg" alt="4-1, 5 points, plus or minus - 11. Congratulations to the Lakers for avoiding the disaster and saving another 25 million"><br>It’s worth mentioning that the Lakers were interested in Ariza this summer. At that time, American media reported that the Lakers hoped that the champion veteran could return. But Ariza chose to join the king, and in reality, the Lakers saved 25 million. They don’t have junk contracts in the squad right now. They make a lot of money</p>

    <title>41 + 9 + 9, the clipper death combo bombed again, Lillard left in frustration, Leonard became the big winner</title>
    <url>/2019/11/10/41%20+%209%20+%209,%20the%20clipper%20death%20combo%20bombed%20again,%20Lillard%20left%20in%20frustration,%20Leonard%20became%20the%20big%20winner/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the Clippers narrowly beat the Blazers 107-101 at home. Leonard didn’t say much about this game. Today, after his comeback, he was not in a very good condition. As Mr. Yang Yi said, after a truce, Xiao Ka is still a little weak today. It seems that he is still injured. Leonard scored 27 points, 13 rebounds and 2 blocks in 9 of 23 shots. The first half was not good, but the last quarter was tough enough. Of course, the Clippers rely on the combination of substitute duo Harrell and Luwei, who are called the death combination by fans. As long as we play, we will reap the opponent’s life.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/41 + 9 + 9, the clipper death combo bombed again, Lillard left in frustration, Leonard became the big winner/d7901750cd054b2db84871c0579fffa3.jpg" alt="41 + 9 + 9, the clipper death combo bombed again, Lillard left in frustration, Leonard became the big winner"><br>Today’s game really shows the strength of the clipper’s substitute. In the first quarter of today, both sides feel bad. Zubates and Leonard each scored two points under the basket. Lillard also threw a 3 + 1, and hood raised his hand and shot three points. Then Leonard and Lillard went against each other. Leonard hit the layup and Lillard went back.<br>It wasn’t until Ludwig’s appearance that the Clippers began to turn around their frustrations, and the combination of him and Patterson kept scoring. The first clipper led by 4 points 26-22. In the second quarter, Harrell started to work. He finished under the basket in a row, and the Clippers pulled the difference to 8 points. But betsmore and mccollham also responded with five points. The Blazers continued to bite the difference.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/41 + 9 + 9, the clipper death combo bombed again, Lillard left in frustration, Leonard became the big winner/a62ba365ae9045d28ecd8d2ca1158a3b.jpg" alt="41 + 9 + 9, the clipper death combo bombed again, Lillard left in frustration, Leonard became the big winner"><br>But it’s still more powerful on the clipper side. The combination of Ludwig and zubates is working again. Zubates made a hook under the basket, Dewey scored 2 points, and the next round made two free throws. The Clippers took the lead of 11 points, and at the critical moment Lillard came out again. He hit a three-point hemostasis and made several breakthroughs to finish.<br>The Clippers had a 7-point lead in half-time, and in the second half the trailblazers began to wake up, with ToRiver scoring 3 + 1, mccollham shooting 2 points and hitting 2 + 1. Lillard also kept scoring, the Blazers made a wave. At the end of the third quarter from seven points behind to six points ahead.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/41 + 9 + 9, the clipper death combo bombed again, Lillard left in frustration, Leonard became the big winner/8efe583cfe124a9da90a5834a46fc2c3.jpg" alt="41 + 9 + 9, the clipper death combo bombed again, Lillard left in frustration, Leonard became the big winner"><br>At the end of the day, the trailblazers once got an 8-point lead, and the Clippers finally woke up. Leonard began to find the feel, and his combination with Harrell kept hitting the Blazers. On the other hand, the Blazers can only rely on Simmons to maintain the difference. But in the end, it was hard to stop the clipper’s attack. After Leonard hit the mid-range shot, the clipper got a 1-point lead again.<br>In the last two minutes, Dewey became the clipper’s thigh. He first hit a mid-range shot, then hit a key three-point shot. It can be said that Dewey’s role in the Clippers today is even higher than Leonard’s.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/41 + 9 + 9, the clipper death combo bombed again, Lillard left in frustration, Leonard became the big winner/deb501868d934538a34e84b3fea31a51.jpg" alt="41 + 9 + 9, the clipper death combo bombed again, Lillard left in frustration, Leonard became the big winner"><br>The Blazers did their best in the game, mcclenham 22 points 7 rebounds, Lillard 22 points 6 rebounds 6 assists. But the clipper side of the death combination is too strong, Lu Wei cut 26 points 3 rebounds 8 assists 3 blocks, Haller 15 points 6 rebounds 1 assists. The two cut down 41 + 9 + 9 data. Zubates scored 15 points and 13 rebounds, while Jamie green scored 10 points and 10 rebounds.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/41 + 9 + 9, the clipper death combo bombed again, Lillard left in frustration, Leonard became the big winner/a4636ad65d4c4935ab2be7aad3d84ff3.jpg" alt="41 + 9 + 9, the clipper death combo bombed again, Lillard left in frustration, Leonard became the big winner"><br>After the game, Lillard left the field depressed and fell into stagnation. Because Leonard was in such a bad state, the Blazers lost. If we meet in the playoffs, the Blazers can’t really beat the Clippers. They were a lot worse when Leonard didn’t come. Because the Clippers had six fights with Warriors when they didn’t have Leonard and George, and Durant’s all-out warriors were still there. The Blazers were shaved by warriors. It can only be said that Leonard became a big winner. It is not a slogan to have such a substitute clipper championship.</p>

    <title>44+10! 27+7! It&#39;s only three years since sICAM caught up with Ingram. Wharton is a pig knife</title>
    <url>/2019/11/10/44+10!%2027+7!%20It&#39;s%20only%20three%20years%20since%20sICAM%20caught%20up%20with%20Ingram.%20Wharton%20is%20a%20pig%20knife/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the Raptors beat the pelicans 122-104 away. It was given to the opponent for three consecutive defeats. The highlight of this game is undoubtedly the confrontation between sICAM and Ingram. Today, they put out 71 points + 17 boards. Ingram scored 27 points, 7 rebounds and 1 stealer in 31 minutes, shooting 10 of 25 shots. Sikam played 39 minutes, 27-for-17 with 44 points, 10 rebounds and 4 assists.<br>Both of them are Rookies of 16 years, but the ranking is very different. Ingram is the second best rookie in the first round of 2016. And sICAM is the 27th rookie in the first round of 2016. Three years ago, there was a 25 order difference between the two draft candidates. Basically no one would have expected cicam’s trajectory to be on a par with Ingram’s.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/44+10! 27+7! It's only three years since sICAM caught up with Ingram. Wharton is a pig knife/bc0d8a7a9d8144f392bcac9934fe48bf.jpg" alt="44+10! 27+7! It&#39;s only three years since sICAM caught up with Ingram. Wharton is a pig knife"><br>A rookie at the end of the first round is slowly catching up with the top spot, and Ingram is not the top spot in the water, which is very difficult. SICAM may be a typical example of another long arm attack after alphabet elder brother. In terms of the influence and attack efficiency of today’s game, there is no doubt that sICAM is more efficient than Ingram.<br>The Raptors hit the pelicans, and from the beginning of the first quarter, sICAM and Ingram raced against each other. This way, sICAM scored 2 + 1. Ingram over there also scored a 3 + 1 response. Ingram made a mid-range shot, and sikam made a three-point shot immediately. The two sides tied 30-30 in the first quarter!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/44+10! 27+7! It's only three years since sICAM caught up with Ingram. Wharton is a pig knife/3d5a504ab7e14461a62b595474ec28c3.jpg" alt="44+10! 27+7! It&#39;s only three years since sICAM caught up with Ingram. Wharton is a pig knife"><br>In the second quarter, the fierce substitutes of raptors undoubtedly crushed the pelicans. They started 15-0. Forcing the pelican to replace Ingram, he was a 2 + 1 to help the pelican stop bleeding. It’s a pity that Raptors can’t hold on, anunoby can’t be stopped, and Powell keeps taking points. The Raptors pulled the difference to 19. The pelican has fallen before sikam can make it.<br>Although Ingram and Holliday scored 5 points, Gasol also made a three-point response. Cicham and van Jordan also hit three three points. Pelican can only rely on okafu to score low, Ingram piecemeal. The Raptors led by 22 points at half-time, 75-53.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/44+10! 27+7! It's only three years since sICAM caught up with Ingram.

Wharton is a pig knife"><br>In the second half, the pelican had a good chance to turn over the set, because Lori and Ibaka were injured. But the pelican is still unable to fight back. Every time Ingram takes the pelican to power, sICAM and anunobi can always respond. In the third quarter, the Raptors were still 22 points ahead, and the pelicans just couldn’t catch up.<br>At the end of the season, the pelican tried to fight back, making a wave of 10-1 under Ingram and holliday. But anunobi again used three points to extinguish the pelican’s counterattack fire. In the end, the difference has been hovering at 15 points, neither up nor down. The pelican has no choice but to swallow the bitter fruit.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/44+10! 27+7! It's only three years since sICAM caught up with Ingram. Wharton is a pig knife/92236c58ce444d9988390cab7b5ea646.jpg" alt="44+10! 27+7! It&#39;s only three years since sICAM caught up with Ingram. Wharton is a pig knife"><br>The Raptors went out of sikam, anunobi also cut 21 points and 7 boards, and van freet 12 points and 11 assists. The pelican’s only way to share the pressure with Ingram is with Holliday, who has 16 points, 6 boards and 6 AIDS. Bauer’s performance is disappointing. Two out of eight shots scored five points.<br>Ingram is averaging 26 points, 7.1 rebounds and 4.3 assists this season. The hit rate was 52.7% and the three-point hit rate was 44.4%. In the fourth season, the outbreak was completed.<br>SICAM has 28 points, 9.2 boards and 3.6 assists per game this season. The hit rate was 51.9%, 41.3%. Although the two figures are similar, both broke out in the fourth season.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/44+10! 27+7! It's only three years since sICAM caught up with Ingram. Wharton is a pig knife/16ca6a2f65164b7abfbc7c3327835464.jpg" alt="44+10! 27+7! It&#39;s only three years since sICAM caught up with Ingram. Wharton is a pig knife"><br>But it’s Ingram who lost when he was on the same level as the rookie at the end of the first round. It can only be said that Ingram didn’t get enough ball rights in the Lakers’ years. People say that time is a butcher’s knife, but Wharton’s equalitarianism is also a butcher’s knife, which restricts Ingram’s growth.<br>If the previous few years were to call unlimited, just like the thunder gave rookie Durant unlimited, Ingram’s ceiling should not be the only one.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/44+10! 27+7! It's only three years since sICAM caught up with Ingram. Wharton is a pig knife/a3c7a01e28774060a5e83328f210c0e9.jpg" alt="44+10! 27+7! It&#39;s only three years since sICAM caught up with Ingram.

    <content><![CDATA[<p>On November 17, the NBA regular season continued, with Timberwolves at home against the rest city team. The two teams are back-to-back. The host team lost the last game to the last wizards in the East, and the whole team began to miss Wiggins after the game. The visiting team has been in a very hot state recently, winning 6 consecutive games against the Pacers in the last game, and continues to rank second in the West, biting the Lakers. Finally, after four competitions, the Timberwolves lost 105-125 at home and gave them 7 consecutive wins.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/47+44+49! Hardon's out of his mind. Wes is happy. The biggest enemy of the Lakers is here/5a6ddafd617a40ab9b7555e89f0e119c.jpg" alt="47+44+49! Hardon&#39;s out of his mind. Wes is happy. The biggest enemy of the Lakers is here"><br>In this game, both teams are absent from the main team. Wiggins, one of the core players of the Timberwolves, has not come back because of the death of his grandmother. The visiting team is a bit miserable. Gordon, Capella and house are all absent due to injuries, while Wes is on a sabbatical. After the start of the game, the two teams were in good condition. When they fell into the saw battle, the Timberwolves took the lead by virtue of multi-point flowering, but then the visiting team realized the anti overtaking under the leadership of Haden, leading 31-30 in the first quarter; in the second quarter, the two teams still fell into the saw battle, with good offensive state, and the two teams could not open the difference, and the Timberwolves fell 2 points behind in the half. In the second half, the visiting team gradually took the initiative. With a wave of 14-2 attack waves, the difference was once opened; in the last quarter, the Timberwolves’ hand feeling was still very low, and the visiting team opened the difference, and the game entered the garbage time. The visiting team won the Timberwolves 125-105 and won 7 consecutive victories.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/47+44+49! Hardon's out of his mind. Wes is happy. The biggest enemy of the Lakers is here/275ad8c8a53e43f39093a619a01e58d0.jpg" alt="47+44+49! Hardon&#39;s out of his mind. Wes is happy. The biggest enemy of the Lakers is here"><br>In the absence of four main players, the rest of the city team can still win, all thanks to harden, in today’s game again crazy. In 38 minutes, 16 of 41 shots, 8 of 22 three-point shots, 9 of 11 free throws, 49 points, 6 assists and 5 rebounds, it can be said that one person carried the attack of the whole team. It’s 40 + in three consecutive games and 40 + in the seventh game of the season. It’s really crazy. In the face of the Clippers’ 47 points, in the face of the walkers’ 44 points, this game is 49 points, which makes the opponent how to defend? It’s no wonder that Wei Shao is willing to be a dowry, and has handed over the main attack power to Haden.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/47+44+49! Hardon's out of his mind. Wes is happy. The biggest enemy of the Lakers is here/3a5620e2021a4b1da3ba4d5740c81a1c.jpg" alt="47+44+49! Hardon&#39;s out of his mind. Wes is happy. The biggest enemy of the Lakers is here"><br>Watching Haden’s excellent performance, let the Wei Shao sit down is very excited, very happy. At the last moment, Wei Shao imitated the action of harden and was very happy. It seems that this time Wei Shao did not make a wrong choice. When he came to Houston, his third brother has become more and more outstanding, which is worth relying on.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/47+44+49! Hardon's out of his mind. Wes is happy. The biggest enemy of the Lakers is here/c40507a81e174860a8e38c4c4a63b2b9.jpg" alt="47+44+49! Hardon&#39;s out of his mind. Wes is happy. The biggest enemy of the Lakers is here"><br>In addition, in addition to Hardon’s outstanding performance in this game, mcclermo also continued the hot feeling of the last game, playing for 37 minutes, 7 of 16 shots, 4 of 3-pointer 11, getting 20 points, 4 rebounds and 2 steals; the most surprising thing is Clemens, who is 1.75 meters away, playing for 28 minutes, 7 of 11 shots, 5 of 3-pointer 9, getting a career high 19 points, with a positive and negative value of + 32; Hartenstein is also playing Good swing, grabbed 16 rebounds, which Zhouqi really can’t compare with others.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/47+44+49! Hardon's out of his mind. Wes is happy. The biggest enemy of the Lakers is here/a5ba47e1e11941af89f1e415b2f88923.jpg" alt="47+44+49! Hardon&#39;s out of his mind. Wes is happy. The biggest enemy of the Lakers is here"><br>The Houston team has won seven games in a row, only half a game away from the top Lakers. After more than ten games in the new season, the biggest enemy of the Lakers has appeared, not the Clippers but the Houston team. In particular, the Lakers should be very careful about Hadden’s excellent performance this season. At present, the two sides haven’t played each other, and they will have a duel at that time.</p>

    <title>48 points blood wash! Cole was ridiculed by NBA officials. Green was in a low mood. This warrior was miserable</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>November 21, the end of the morning of an NBA regular season, lone ranger home against the warriors, the game played for 5 minutes, the suspense is gone! The lone ranger scored five three-point goals in a row at the start of the game and soon took a 24-7 lead, while none of the warriors was able to respond. 142-94, the warriors suffer 48 points of blood! At the end of the game, Cole took a long breath and gulped down a mouthful of mineral water. The warrior was so miserable that it was hard to watch him.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/48 points blood wash! Cole was ridiculed by NBA officials. Green was in a low mood. This warrior was miserable/705ca68d4fb7467a8ea02ecaf8b2c94b.jpg" alt="48 points blood wash! Cole was ridiculed by NBA officials. Green was in a low mood. This warrior was miserable"><br>The warriors announced a truce before the game. In yesterday’s game with Grizzlies, green hurt his elbow in the third quarter, but today’s reason for his absence is pain in his right foot and heel! Pascal returns to the position of power forward, with the lowest positive and negative value, - 43, but it’s not his fault. Warriors only have 8 players in total. Pascal insists for 40 minutes, and he doesn’t even have a substitute. Of course, Pascal is also the best performance and the most stable offensive side of the warriors. He got 22 points and 7 rebounds in 8 of 19, while Stan, the only one of the warriors who can count on the NBA level, only got 7 points and 4 rebounds in 25 minutes.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/48 points blood wash! Cole was ridiculed by NBA officials. Green was in a low mood. This warrior was miserable/95de57741e90410aab5d711c5334a9e9.jpg" alt="48 points blood wash! Cole was ridiculed by NBA officials. Green was in a low mood. This warrior was miserable"><br>In fact, the game in the first quarter has lost the suspense, dongqiqi’s hot outside hand directly destroyed the warriors, dongqiqi’s own 25 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists in a single quarter, more than the warriors combined! In the second quarter, dongqiqi scored 11 points in just 4 minutes. The warriors were 49 points behind. Thanks to dongqiqi, dongqiqi scored 35 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds in this game. He was only 20 years old!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/48 points blood wash! Cole was ridiculed by NBA officials. Green was in a low mood. This warrior was miserable/d29cd6f6cbb94ee4a4ba63acb27a0704.jpg" alt="48 points blood wash! Cole was ridiculed by NBA officials. Green was in a low mood. This warrior was miserable"><br>In the second quarter, when he was completely beaten by the lone ranger, the camera shot Cole. When NBA gave him a caption to introduce Cole, there was a line of kids below. The record of Coaching: 325-100! 76.5% win! Naked mockery! This season the warriors are only 3-13, far from the Knicks, bulls, spurs, blazers and other teams! I believe that there will be no change in the future for a long time, unless brother Shuihua comes back.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/48 points blood wash! Cole was ridiculed by NBA officials. Green was in a low mood. This warrior was miserable/081a4ab65eea440eb980e93da8272623.jpg" alt="48 points blood wash! Cole was ridiculed by NBA officials. Green was in a low mood. This warrior was miserable"><br>When the camera is shot on the injured green, his mood is even lower. According to the commentary, the pain in Green’s right heel is not a big problem. Usually we walk a lot and the heel is also sore! After beating the Grizzlies yesterday, Green said he would fight with injuries in the face of today’s situation, hoping to take on the responsibility as a leader. Maybe Cole doesn’t take him as the leader. In fact, Cole doesn’t hold any hope for this game. I believe that’s the same with green! But everyone did not expect that warriors would lose so badly!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/48 points blood wash! Cole was ridiculed by NBA officials. Green was in a low mood. This warrior was miserable/014965d69b9045ccb7af41f8f9bd3e7f.jpg" alt="48 points blood wash! Cole was ridiculed by NBA officials. Green was in a low mood. This warrior was miserable"><br>Pascal is the only bright spot of the warriors in this game. He doesn’t take the lead in the contest with Poseidon. He forces Poseidon to shoot only 6 out of 14. He is the only one who feels weak in this game of lone ranger. However, two fists can’t beat four hands. The warriors need to use more games to exercise Pascal at this stage. Compared with green, Pascal is definitely more worthy of the warriors’ trust in the future.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/48 points blood wash! Cole was ridiculed by NBA officials. Green was in a low mood. This warrior was miserable/acc063ab6dd74342aa6731726c9ff2e6.jpg" alt="48 points blood wash! Cole was ridiculed by NBA officials. Green was in a low mood. This warrior was miserable"><br>The warriors are still not optimistic in the future. The day after tomorrow, they will face the thunder and the bulls, and then they will start their journey to the East. I don’t know how long Cole’s winning record will last, and how many teams will ravage the warriors. At this stage, they will only be beaten.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the Bulls lost 94-117 to give their opponents three straight wins. In this game, the Bulls star Raven did not perform well. He only got 11 points and 5 assists in 5-for-17 shots, with the positive and negative values of the whole team down. Today, the bulls are in a mess at the offensive end of the game. How many three points have been released on the outside, but they can’t throw in. And the players are in a very low form, with only 13 points for marcanin. It was a frustrating game for the bulls, who were slaughtered at home. It seems that this season the Bulls want to rise is far away.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/5 out of 17, only 11 points!

Raven&#39;s worst World War I, Hadden and weishao hit their chests to celebrate their three consecutive victories"><br>Today’s game starts from the first quarter, the two sides play iron with each other, and they should play the basket askew. It took a few minutes for Raven to find his touch. He scored three goals in a row. But after these three goals, raven began to fall into a magic spell. He couldn’t get in any way. On the contrary, the opponent’s fighting is fierce. Hadden layup, house and little rivers keep shooting long shots. The bull was in the downwind at one time, but mal began to work hard, leading the team to play a wave of 13-0 to lose the opponent’s armor.<br>The Bulls led by seven points 27-20 in the first quarter. In the second quarter, both sides fell into the strangulation. The combination of Haden and Capella kept scoring, and Haden scored 11 points in a row. On the bull’s side, he used push and counterattack to catch the difference and kept hitting the basket to score. Raven also hit the first goal after the first quarter. He made a violent dunk in the fast break. The bulls are still one point ahead at half-time!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/5 out of 17, only 11 points!

Raven&#39;s worst World War I, Hadden and weishao hit their chests to celebrate their three consecutive victories"><br>In the first half, the Bulls did not feel good. In the case of 15 mistakes, the Bulls did not seize the opportunity to open the difference. In the first half, they scored 2 out of 17 points, and the outside performance was very poor.<br>In the second half, the Bulls couldn’t resist the attack wave of the opponent, and the combination of Wei Shao and harden began to explode. The bulls were 11 points straight behind. It’s not easy to wait for harden to go down, the opponent’s backup lineup broke out again. Little rivers and tuck Gordon hit four three points. The bulls are 22 points behind. After all, they are basically beaten.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/5 out of 17, only 11 points!

Raven&#39;s worst World War I, Hadden and weishao hit their chests to celebrate their three consecutive victories"><br>At the end of the day, the bull was still unable to respond. The outside line felt cold. In terms of the data of the whole game, Carter scored 13 points and 16 boards, Hutchison scored 13 points, markanin scored 13 points, raven scored 11 points and 5 assists, satolanski scored 10 points and 4 assists and 3 breaks. Rookie Cobi white also scored 10 points in 4 of 16 shots.<br>On the opponent’s side, James Harden scored 42 points, 10 boards, 9 assists and 6 mistakes in 3-point, 19-for-9 shooting, while Wes missed 26 points, 7 boards and 7 mistakes. The two superstars made 13 joint mistakes, and the bulls were beaten like this. It’s not that the opponent is too strong, it’s just that he’s too weak, he’ll be beaten.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/5 out of 17, only 11 points!

Raven&#39;s worst World War I, Hadden and weishao hit their chests to celebrate their three consecutive victories"><br>After Michael Jordan, the Bulls went down for several seasons. In the election, derrickross began to rise and made a series of playoffs. He has become a new upstart in the East, but it’s a pity that Roth’s fate is so bumpy that he has not reached the peak because of injuries. Rose is also a wanderer away from the bulls, in the Timberwolves began to rejuvenate, this season in the piston state is not bad, but the minor injury is still continuous.<br>After Ross was traded by the bull, Butler was righted as the boss. But as a result, the team couldn’t get up and down, and butler was traded again. The Bulls continued to rot, year after year, almost like the Knicks.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/5 out of 17, only 11 points!

    <title>5, 27, 18 free throws! No wonder Downes said you were soft</title>
    <url>/2019/11/10/5,%2027,%2018%20free%20throws!%20No%20wonder%20Downes%20said%20you%20were%20soft/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In the game that ends today, jazz home 106-104 narrowly wins 76 people. In this game, ebbed came back. He was banned by the League because of a fight with Downes. But after the comeback, enbeder’s condition is still relatively poor. Facing the Jazz God tagobel in the whole game, the great emperor has been blocked. But one of the great things about ebbed is his ability to make free throws. Enbid is known as the big version of Haden. Although ebbed only made five goals in 16 shots, his free throw was 16 out of 18.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/5, 27, 18 free throws! No wonder Downes said you were soft/4d2bf6be80034ad78327105fe8f9fa17.jpg" alt="5, 27, 18 free throws! No wonder Downes said you were soft"><br>That is to say, when he hit 5 goals, he got 27 points + 16 boards. The ability to make fouls is really fierce. In terms of the course of the game, the 76ers are in the downwind. From the beginning of the first quarter, the Jazz showed their level of attack and defense, Conley as the brain. First, he broke through the layup, then played a duet with gobel to keep killing the basket.<br>Mitchell has also started to score eight points in a row. The Jazz opened the score. The 76ers relied on Richardson’s mid-range shot, and ebbed also hit a three-point outside. The 76ers led 29-26 in the first quarter, but the Jazz still showed the 76ers what it’s like to defend with iron. In particular, gobel’s ability to protect the frame is terrible.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/5, 27, 18 free throws! No wonder Downes said you were soft/5d87091c757c4606af066cf908e6b3ea.jpg" alt="5, 27, 18 free throws! No wonder Downes said you were soft"><br>In the second quarter, the jazz began to fight back. The combination of Ingels and Jeff Green started to break out. They scored two and three points in a row. Mitchell had a good shot in the middle. Boyan also showed his attack ability, in the half-time Jazz completed anti super lead 76 people 2 points. In the second half, Simmons didn’t play because of a shoulder injury. The jazz took the opportunity to hit the attack wave, and gobel completed an air contact button to make enbid shake his head and sigh.<br>Mitchell scored 5 points in a row. First, he hit steadily in the middle distance, and then he raised his hand to score three points. The Jazz made a wave of attacks, leading by 13 points. After the 76ers rely on Richardson and embid’s serve constantly close to the difference, in the third quarter the 76ers catch up with only 11 points.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/5, 27, 18 free throws! No wonder Downes said you were soft/6c76965e5e6c402787ad8524652224a8.jpg" alt="5, 27, 18 free throws! No wonder Downes said you were soft"><br>At the end of the day, 76 people launched a fierce attack. Mr. Harris, the top salary man, scored 8 points in a row and nearly scored 5 points. But Conley came out, first with the CIC, and then with the neituo fast break, he became 2 + 1 tough. But embid still staged a free throw feast. At the end of the fourth quarter, embid made a free throw in succession, and in the last two minutes, the lead made the difference close to two points again, which made the Jazz shake their heads and smile bitterly.<br>But Boyan became the key Sir of jazz, and he used three points to pay back to enbid and once again spread the difference to 5 points. At the critical moment of his life and death, he made one of two free throws and Richardson also made a mistake in passing. The 76ers lost to the jazz.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/5, 27, 18 free throws! No wonder Downes said you were soft/0e1fed065b894547b7680354f0c74236.jpg" alt="5, 27, 18 free throws! No wonder Downes said you were soft"><br>In the whole game, all three Jazz Giants contributed, Mitchell got 24 points, 5 rebounds and 8 assists, Bogdanovic 20 points, Conley 15 points, gobel 14 points, 16 rebounds and 3 steals, but the last six offenders left the court.<br>For 5 of 16 shots, 16 of 18 free throws, 27 points, 16 rebounds and 2 blocks, it’s obvious that the performance of enbid made Gerber not convinced. It’s worth mentioning that Downes was very dissatisfied with embid before. The reason why they fought was that embid had been infuriating Downes. Later, when the two sides were fighting, enbid’s head was held by Downes, and enbid buttoned Downes’s eyes with his hands.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/5, 27, 18 free throws! No wonder Downes said you were soft/d5348260fb6241a0b67e9a64150b19b7.jpg" alt="5, 27, 18 free throws! No wonder Downes said you were soft"><br>In that game, Downes used to describe ebbed as soft and not afraid of him. Downes also quipped on social media that embid had been beaten to tears by Leonard last season.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/5, 27, 18 free throws! No wonder Downes said you were soft/605630c606244010b807fb4b94f78334.jpg" alt="5, 27, 18 free throws! No wonder Downes said you were soft"></p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the Cavaliers beat the Wizards 113-100 away. The Cavaliers’ champions, two stars lefo and Thompson, went crazy again. In the whole game, 8 of Thompson 12 thundered 21 points, 12 boards, 3 assists, 3 breaks and 2 caps. Lefu cut 16 points + 12 boards. Two people cut 37 points + 25 boards together.<br>It’s a pity that hacumura did his best today. He made 13 shots and 10 shots in 35 minutes, scored 21 points and 7 rebounds, 3 assists and 2 steals. Unfortunately, he was unable to return to the sky and became the background emperor of Thompson.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/8 in 12 roars 21 + 12! Thompson is crazy again.

The contract year is really fierce. The best battle is in the eight villages"><br>Today, the Cavaliers are also following the wind and water. From the beginning of the first quarter, the Cavaliers are all firing. Osman and Thompson continued to score, leading the Cavaliers to a 12-2 start. After that, the Wizards began to work. Eight villages shot in the outside line, and Bryant also won many times under the basket. Little Thomas hits the basket and throws.<br>In the first quarter, the wizard chased the difference to only 4 points, but in the second quarter, the Cavaliers started again. Their backup team blew up, NANs scored points and rookie portley scored 6 points in a row. The Cavaliers had a 15-2 lead. Although the eight villages opened the mode of big kill and special kill again, they hit long-range shots continuously. But the Cavaliers still had a 15 point lead at half-time.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/8 in 12 roars 21 + 12! Thompson is crazy again. The contract year is really fierce.

The best battle is in the eight villages"><br>In the third quarter, the Cavaliers continued to play a wave. The combination of Loew and super rookie Jack Sexton started to work. They scored 10 points in a row. The Cavaliers have extended the difference to 21. It looks like the game has been thrown into garbage time. But Kimura didn’t give up. At the end of the festival, he and Bryant sounded the counterattack horn together. The Wizards began to chase points fiercely.<br>Eight villages continuously score, bertans also frequently hit three points in the outside line. In the third quarter the Wizards have narrowed the 21 point gap to just four. At the end of the season, Smith made a 2-point shot in an empty position, and the wizard had already chased the difference to 1 point. When the knights were on the brink of extinction, it was the combination of Thompson and Loew that started to work, and Clarkson didn’t hit it.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/8 in 12 roars 21 + 12!

The contract year is really fierce. The best battle is in the eight villages"><br>The Cavaliers once again hit a small climax of attack, regaining a 7-point lead. Lofoy also made free throws in a row. Thompson also killed the wizards with two hook shots at the last moment, allowing the Cavaliers to lock in the victory.<br>In the whole game, we don’t need to talk about the data of lofoy and Thompson. Let’s focus on the three Rookies of Cavaliers. Today, Sexton scored 16 points, garland scored 15 points and 6 assists, and Porter scored 13 points. At the critical moment, Sexton showed his heart and hit a three-point goal.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/8 in 12 roars 21 + 12! Thompson is crazy again.

The contract year is really fierce. The best battle is in the eight villages"><br>Garland’s organizational ability is also being played. Porter’s defensive end is still a little poor. There is no problem in attack. Bill has 20 points and 9 assists and Bryant has 23 points, 8 boards and 4 assists. This combination of inside and outside must have done its best.<br>It has to be said that TT Thompson is really fierce this season, and this year is exactly Thompson’s contract year. Thompson can get 17.4 points, 11.8 boards, 2.8 assists and 1.6 blocks in 33.9 minutes per game this season, with a hit rate of 55%. And Thompson also has the charisma of a leader, and lefo has become his assistant.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/8 in 12 roars 21 + 12! Thompson is crazy again.

Now, with the data of 17 + 11, I’m afraid his annual salary will double.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>On November 22, a regular season NBA game ended at noon, the sun’s home game against the pelican, today’s game is not much, so this game is quite eye-catching. 121-124: Pelican beat suns away. This game is the comeback of ball Gore Bauer. Coach Jim Terry put him into the reserve team. He played in 19 minutes, 3 in 9, and got 8 points and 5 assists. There were 3 mistakes. It was embarrassing.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/8 points 5 assists! Tianzhijiaozi becomes a fish belly substitute, the Lakers bet right! Pelican, cry if you want/4b1504d95233449aa8f6301581390b7d.jpg" alt="8 points 5 assists! Tianzhijiaozi becomes a fish belly substitute, the Lakers bet right! Pelican, cry if you want"><br>Brother got 5 minutes in the first quarter, four shots in total, and got 5 points. The two main players, Redick and Holliday, were hot today, while brother took the substitute to lose points. It can’t be blamed for the lack of scoring points on the pelican’s bench. In the second quarter, the golfer came out for six minutes with zero contribution and only one assist. He failed to make three-point shots in two attempts on the outside line. Jin Terry soon replaced him, while the pelican was slowly caught up by the sun.<br>In the third quarter, brother Qiu hit a third point again, but in the fourth quarter, he only had three minutes to play, and still didn’t make any contribution. Then he was replaced and watched his teammates win another game.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/8 points 5 assists! Tianzhijiaozi becomes a fish belly substitute, the Lakers bet right! Pelican, cry if you want/7dbe30dc5e1643dca6e69312b6ea61b2.jpg" alt="8 points 5 assists! Tianzhijiaozi becomes a fish belly substitute, the Lakers bet right! Pelican, cry if you want"><br>First of all, we can be sure that brother Qiu was put on the bench by Terry Jintai. First, he was worried about his injury. After all, he just came back, and his body was not in the best condition. The second point is that the main force of the team has been put into shape now, and the ball brother will come back and have to fight again. Today, Redick and Holliday’s backcourt combination roared 49 points, which are the two main factors for Pelican to win.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/8 points 5 assists! Tianzhijiaozi becomes a fish belly substitute, the Lakers bet right! Pelican, cry if you want/2c33e884365d45f59ffe277f6379a17e.jpg" alt="8 points 5 assists! Tianzhijiaozi becomes a fish belly substitute, the Lakers bet right! Pelican, cry if you want"><br>Before that, because of the strain of the right adductor muscle, brother Qiu missed the game for two weeks in a row. In his absence, huoledi shouldered the team’s main beam, with an average of 23.4 points + 10 assists in the last five games, far higher efficiency than brother Qiu, including beating the clippers, the warriors and the Blazers in the last game. Huoledi was the team’s number one hero, and Jin Terry’s evaluation of huoledi was not allowed Replace! But after all, brother Qiu represents the future, which makes pelicans difficult to deal with!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/8 points 5 assists! Tianzhijiaozi becomes a fish belly substitute, the Lakers bet right! Pelican, cry if you want/3219fca2662240cfae749460a56244c8.jpg" alt="8 points 5 assists! Tianzhijiaozi becomes a fish belly substitute, the Lakers bet right! Pelican, cry if you want"><br>At the beginning, the Lakers were willing to take out Hart, golfer and Ingram, including the first round of signing to bet on bushmei. In fact, it seemed quite risky at that time, including the initial trading assumption that pelicans would pick anyone, as long as they were willing to trade bushmei. The Lakers are focused on the new season, while the pelicans are forced to focus on the future. Now the Lakers are firmly in the first place in the west, while the pelican is in the back of the West.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/8 points 5 assists! Tianzhijiaozi becomes a fish belly substitute, the Lakers bet right! Pelican, cry if you want/46a63e137037442e8d343e34482f5f2d.jpg" alt="8 points 5 assists! Tianzhijiaozi becomes a fish belly substitute, the Lakers bet right! Pelican, cry if you want"><br>Yingge or Hart, including Qiuge, they need time after all. To say that Pelican really got from Lakers, there is only one Ingram. Golfer and Holliday are in the same position. Holliday is only 29 years old. He can play in the position of point guard for a long time. Hart’s injury has been stopped. Besides, there are not many opportunities for him from jinterry. Now the pelican basically relies on Holliday to lead the team.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/8 points 5 assists! Tianzhijiaozi becomes a fish belly substitute, the Lakers bet right! Pelican, cry if you want/18d7be5f5c704508abd72333b6e318d8.jpg" alt="8 points 5 assists! Tianzhijiaozi becomes a fish belly substitute, the Lakers bet right! Pelican, cry if you want"><br>The Lakers are right. Give up the so-called young talent players and let them go to the pelican to have more room to exercise. Pelican is in a dilemma. Of course, the biggest problem now is the coexistence of golfer and holliday. Of course, a healthy golfer can still serve as the first team, but at this stage, golfer’s position is actually particularly awkward. Holliday’s contribution and role are far greater than golfer’s, but we can’t let the former top two and the most talented start to play as a substitute in the third year of our career, right?</p>

    <title>8 points, 10 boards and 11 AIDS! 19 points! The warriors finally won. It&#39;s Green&#39;s first win</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In an NBA regular season game that ended on the morning of November 20, grizzlies faced warriors at home. Before that, warriors suffered the longest seven consecutive defeats in Cole’s time. Many American media believed that the team should consider trading green and seriously training young players this season. But I believe that there is always a treasure at home. Cole won’t be confused. Even if Pascal feels hot, Cole still stubbornly asks green to play power forward. Well, today he finally won! 114-95, warriors defeated warriors away from home and ended seven consecutive defeats. This victory is also the first victory of Green’s team in this season!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/8 points, 10 boards and 11 AIDS! 19 points! The warriors finally won. It's Green's first win/cdc5439799f34d62be128e203cfc80b9.jpg" alt="8 points, 10 boards and 11 AIDS! 19 points! The warriors finally won. It&#39;s Green&#39;s first win"><br>In fact, from the beginning of the first quarter, green gave full play to his role as an offensive hub, including the ground pass to Robinson and help Berks lay up. After his teammates changed from Durant, clay and curry to Pascal, Robinson and Berks, green still didn’t forget his role as a passer. He had space, didn’t throw, three rebounds in a single quarter, five assists, on the court or win Divided. In the second quarter, the warriors in the wave of attack climax of Berks and Robinson, the difference between the two was immediately opened to about 20 points. At this time, Green’s contribution was to protect the rebounds. Stan also had a wonderful pass to green, and finally layup to break the scoring gap. Throughout the first half warriors easily opened the difference to 15 points, first Grizzlies overall hit rate is not high, second, Berks and Robinson are indispensable.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/8 points, 10 boards and 11 AIDS! 19 points! The warriors finally won. It's Green's first win/c1c54f7cf8c74bf1b3ca89aab6f38e30.jpg" alt="8 points, 10 boards and 11 AIDS! 19 points! The warriors finally won. It&#39;s Green&#39;s first win"><br>The score is far ahead. Green, who entered the third quarter, began to dare to make a shot. He made a long jump shot and a layup. And into the fourth green 2 1, but Berks is a wave of small climax, kill the game suspense!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/8 points, 10 boards and 11 AIDS! 19 points! The warriors finally won. It's Green's first win/2a832bca7b0c49379d9dd017d42bf97d.jpg" alt="8 points, 10 boards and 11 AIDS! 19 points! The warriors finally won. It&#39;s Green&#39;s first win"><br>Since the start of the new season, the warriors’ record has plummeted, including the fracture of Curie, the injury of Rooney and the injury stop of Russell. The warriors are almost unavailable. At one time, the bench seat can lie down. To be honest, it is a test of the coach’s ability and green’s ability to lead the team. At the beginning, when Curie confirmed that he had been injured for at least three months, green was the first to stand up and boost the team’s morale, saying that it was time for him to stand up and lead the team forward like a leader, but to be honest, the two goals won by warriors before the new season had little to do with him. Pelican fight, curry’s still here, Russell’s there. To be a pioneer, I really appreciate Pascal’s outburst. At that time, green was still absent. Nearly a month after the season, the warriors led by green finally won their first game! Rare!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/8 points, 10 boards and 11 AIDS! 19 points! The warriors finally won. It's Green's first win/1d8863fb7617489ab79b63ee9d94a6d2.jpg" alt="8 points, 10 boards and 11 AIDS! 19 points! The warriors finally won. It&#39;s Green&#39;s first win"><br>The warriors are in a dilemma, and the stars who were bullied by green have come out and accused green, including gobel when he talked about Green’s remarks that he thought it was a joke. The playoff mode is to end the season ahead of schedule. Including Paul yelling at green when he was playing Warriors: “go and ask Kevin (Durant) to come back, so you can still play!” Spurs player guy also stood up and said: “do you think there is any sympathy in the League for someone to come back to green? No! “ Even Pelican rookie Hayes mocks green: “man, why don’t you get Stephen and Steve out of here? So you can be the real team boss! “<br>Green is in trouble, please!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/8 points, 10 boards and 11 AIDS! 19 points! The warriors finally won. It's Green's first win/743d8392e631441b884c53d8daa148e8.jpg" alt="8 points, 10 boards and 11 AIDS! 19 points! The warriors finally won. It&#39;s Green&#39;s first win"><br>Of course, sarcasm is sarcasm, but it’s really hard for green to make fans and opponents respect him. Whether it’s the conflict with Durant before, or whether it’s to teach Jordan Poole and evaluate Pascal in the way of old predecessors, to put it bluntly, green just doesn’t show enough performance to prove his own value, but always wants to do some small things. It’s not easy to lead the team to the first win, but the warriors are basically set this season.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, thunder defeated Golden State Warriors 114-108 at home, and Russell became the main character again. The whole field roared 32 points 7 assists 3 backboards again empty cuts, failed to help the warriors win. It is worth mentioning that in the last game, Russell faced the forest wolf, roared 52 points, 9 rebounds and 5 assists. In two games, Russell scored 82 points, 12 assists and 12 boards. But it’s still impossible to win with the team. Russell has become the first team leader in the league.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/84+12+12! Russell cut the new owners, Cole left in frustration, Paul couldn't close his mouth/847ef526b6e448b4a5f881dd8863d63b.jpg" alt="84+12+12! Russell cut the new owners, Cole left in frustration, Paul couldn&#39;t close his mouth"><br>Thunder today is to play at will, Paul did not have such a force to win, Paul 11 in 5 got 16 points 9 assists 5 rebounds performance, in the series or well done, in addition, Schroeder today took up the offensive flag, he substitute got 18 points 6 baskets 6 assists data. Gallinari scored 19 points, shooting 6 out of 11 and 4 out of 6 out of 3. Alexander 12 points. Adams got 13 points and 7 boards.<br>It is worth mentioning that the thunder atmosphere is very good now. There was an interesting scene in the third quarter of today’s game. Adams’s long set was knocked out by the warriors in an attack. Long hair directly covered Adams’s eyes. He had to spend more than ten seconds to rearrange and fix his long hair.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/84+12+12! Russell cut the new owners, Cole left in frustration, Paul couldn't close his mouth/bd34fd303706446189adaed0ed98bafe.jpg" alt="84+12+12! Russell cut the new owners, Cole left in frustration, Paul couldn&#39;t close his mouth"><br>Chris Paul, too, came up to check. He couldn’t close his mouth. At the end of today’s thunder big score lead, Paul is also very relaxed and happy. And today Paul also gave lessons to the warrior players, in the second quarter of the warrior player Sperman in the corner of the main defense Paul. As a result, Cole kept yelling at the young man, “don’t stretch out your hand.” colistan also yelled, “don’t let Paul make a foul.” Paul also had no choice but to smile after listening.<br>According to NBA reporter Erik Horne, because of his fear of Paul’s ability to make fouls, Cole gave a lot of education to the players before the game, including the problem of not fouling Paul.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/84+12+12! Russell cut the new owners, Cole left in frustration, Paul couldn't close his mouth/624f15e7a9fa4309ab260c4c209c52ba.jpg" alt="84+12+12!

After today’s game, Cole and Donovan hugged each other and left in frustration. There’s no way for the team. Let Russell brush more data and rebuild.<br>This year, the warriors will probably lose even if they don’t. The good news, though, is that warriors can return to the throne next year. Thompson is back, curry is back, and green will be healthy. Russell warriors could consider a new front next year.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/84+12+12! Russell cut the new owners, Cole left in frustration, Paul couldn't close his mouth/a5b00db8cfc647a7bda3bf3731fda970.jpg" alt="84+12+12! Russell cut the new owners, Cole left in frustration, Paul couldn&#39;t close his mouth"><br>If the warriors can get a high ranking rookie, then with the original three giants, the warriors can be expected next season. The thunder haven’t given up the playoffs this season. They are now eighth in the West. For Paul, it’s the top salary now, and thunder has a chance to play in the playoffs, which is a good ending.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/84+12+12! Russell cut the new owners, Cole left in frustration, Paul couldn't close his mouth/2686b149d95544de88a6b1f1cec72560.jpg" alt="84+12+12! Russell cut the new owners, Cole left in frustration, Paul couldn&#39;t close his mouth"><br>Isn’t NBA just about making money? Paul at least has a top salary guarantee and the team status has been greatly improved. He is the winner of life. How much is the so-called Championship worth? It’s just icing on the cake.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the Bulls beat the eagles 113-93 away by 20 points. The Hawks returned to trejan’s single core team again, as Thompson Collins next to him continued to be banned from the league. Like Aton, Collins is also applying to the League for a 25 match ban reduction.<br>We don’t know whether it will pass or not, but now the eagle is on the brink of extinction. Trejan needs to play better if they want to make it to the playoffs this season. Today’s performance of 3 out of 12 with only 9 points and 4 mistakes is unable to lead the team further.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/9 points 4 mistakes 20 points, Trey young wake up, Howard has been sent away, you are not bushbrow/5d41aa59acf6468ab4a252e41f62c773.jpg" alt="9 points 4 mistakes 20 points, Trey young wake up, Howard has been sent away, you are not bushbrow"><br>But the bulls are really good. They just pushed the Lakers to the brink yesterday, once leading by 17 points. By the end of the third quarter, the Lakers were 13 points behind. But in the last quarter, the Lakers played a wave of 16-0 anti super under the leadership of Kuzma + Howard + cook. Davis, like today’s trejan, didn’t perform well in that game. Basically, the Lakers only relied on LeBron James to keep the difference in the first half.<br>And the key to the Lakers’ final turnaround is that they have Howard, who has an incredible performance on the defensive side. Howard is like a shield, Kuzma is like a spear.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/9 points 4 mistakes 20 points, Trey young wake up, Howard has been sent away, you are not bushbrow/92a075ea3abc4322a15a33baa973f080.jpg" alt="9 points 4 mistakes 20 points, Trey young wake up, Howard has been sent away, you are not bushbrow"><br>Hawks used to have Howard, but they’ve already sent him away. If the eagles had Howard today, they might have a chance at the end of the day. It’s a pity that the eagles didn’t defend well at the end of the season. It’s hard to fight back. Trey young is not a big brow Davis, in Davis’s downturn, he has James and a group of teammates. Trejan can’t make mistakes. He has to break out every time.<br>Today’s game is really tough, the first quarter and the Lakers. The Bulls started off with a fierce attack, and marcanin continued to score. Satolanski also kept winning, while the Hawks only got three points in the old kart’s life to respond. Trey young scored a 2 + 1, which was the most brilliant goal of Trey Young’s game. The Bulls led by 14 points in the first quarter, 33-19.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/9 points 4 mistakes 20 points, Trey young wake up, Howard has been sent away, you are not bushbrow/158980119ff24e3e8f477456acbceedb.jpg" alt="9 points 4 mistakes 20 points, Trey young wake up, Howard has been sent away, you are not bushbrow"><br>In the second quarter, the bull’s offensive did not decrease. Markanin raised his hand to hit three points at the beginning of the game, and the difference was opened to 17 points. Then the Hawks made a 7-0 approach. But the bulls can always respond, with the Bulls still leading 15 points 56-41 at half-time. In the second half, the bulls were crazy. Raven scored two points with the ball. Marcanin hit three points again. Porter and satolanski even scored 10 points. The bulls have gained a 26 point lead.<br>At this time the familiar script appeared, Trey young layup to help the eagles to stabilize the situation. It’s when everyone’s expecting the eagles to turn around like the Lakers at the end of the season.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/9 points 4 mistakes 20 points, Trey young wake up, Howard has been sent away, you are not bushbrow/79c0ef7cc3cc44de9d956ae76be74343.jpg" alt="9 points 4 mistakes 20 points, Trey young wake up, Howard has been sent away, you are not bushbrow"><br>The eagles couldn’t stop the bulls at the end of the season. They started with a wave of 10-3 to show hope. But the Hawks lack the internal defense gate, which makes the Bulls blossom inside and outside. The difference between the two points is not easy to get close to 20 points, and it is pulled back to 27 points.<br>After today’s game, trejan apologized publicly: “I want to praise the performance of the opponents. They play hard and they play back-to-back. They’ve just been turned around by the Lakers, but today they don’t lose their sense of energy. As a young team, we are not as good as our opponents. I need to be responsible. I need to learn. Because no one will sympathize with us, losing is losing<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/9 points 4 mistakes 20 points, Trey young wake up, Howard has been sent away, you are not bushbrow/e49b19a1af78495698f49fec12462f92.jpg" alt="9 points 4 mistakes 20 points, Trey young wake up, Howard has been sent away, you are not bushbrow"><br>29 minutes, 12 shots, 3 shots, 9 points, 3 rebounds, 3 assists, plus or minus - 16. Trejan must be right to take responsibility. The eagle needs him to kill everywhere.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In an NBA regular season that ended on the morning of November 19, the Knicks faced the Cavaliers at home. Although the Knicks are at the bottom of the East, the gap between them and the front teams is not big. There are only one or two games in the East. After the 7th place, the East is in the same gear, and there is no difference between the strong and the weak! 123-105, the Knicks’ home victory over the Cavaliers is very tough. In the last six games, they won the lone Rangers two times. Today, they won the Cavaliers again. If they were not killed by the Hornets two days ago, they would have left the warriors.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/After the warriors are at the bottom, they don't calm down! Six games, three wins, back to the playoffs/00d431b7a99548bb84787c063df493d8.jpg" alt="After the warriors are at the bottom, they don&#39;t calm down! Six games, three wins, back to the playoffs"><br>In terms of data, for Cavaliers, Osman scored 5 points and 8 rebounds, lofoy announced not to play due to lumbar contusion 3 hours before the game, Thompson scored 9 points and 5 rebounds, garland scored 10 points, Sexton scored 14 points, and Clarkson scored 13 points. On the Knicks side, little Morris has 23 points and 6 rebounds, Randall has 30 points and 7 rebounds, Gibson has 7 points and 8 rebounds, Barrett has 15 points and Dotson has 11 points.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/After the warriors are at the bottom, they don't calm down!

Six games, three wins, back to the playoffs"><br>As soon as the game came up, the Knicks gave the other team a layup of Javier and Gibson. Randall ate the basket continuously, 20-9 after a wave of climax! Then Randall made another three points, and the Cavaliers relied on Clarkson’s substitute at the end of the quarter to slightly recover the difference, 32-20 in a single quarter. In the second quarter, the Knights scored two three points to stop Knicks, and then Randall and Clarkson raced three points to each other, but Knights couldn’t hold up and stopped after Knicks hit three three points in a row. Then garland and Sexton hit a wave of small climax, half-time Knicks lead 13 points. In the third quarter, the Knicks opened the difference after a wave of 6-0, and then Barrett led the team to another wave of small climax, the difference has reached more than 20 points, the Knights replaced the substitute in advance, the game lost suspense, the Knicks led 23 points in the third quarter, the knights in the fourth quarter chasing efficiency is not high, and Knicks also early replaced all the main force, the final score set at 123-105!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/After the warriors are at the bottom, they don't calm down!

Six games, three wins, back to the playoffs"><br>This summer, the operation of Knicks fans magically attracted five power forwards. They can completely form a combination of five deaths. However, they are suicidal. They started badly. They won 1-7, finished at the bottom of the East early, and finished at the bottom of the League! But Doran, the boss, still has a dream. Before that, he said that the team can not always lack competitiveness. If there is a problem with the management, change the management. If there is a problem with the head coach, change the head coach. Fitzdale was also named and criticized by the boss.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/After the warriors are at the bottom, they don't calm down! Six games, three wins, back to the playoffs/59c81d08f75f45a2b19d3107a9410b7c.jpg" alt="After the warriors are at the bottom, they don&#39;t calm down! Six games, three wins, back to the playoffs"><br>Although the Knicks had poor results, they had dignity. Since November 9, when the warriors lost to the Timberwolves again, they began to take the bottom place in the West with a record of 2-7, the Knicks broke out! After that game, Portis also said that the team is now united, we don’t think the strength of the team is just the bottom level in the East. Then including even lost two games to the Cavaliers and the bulls, because some players are absent, but in six days to face the lone ranger again, and win another! Including the last game against the Hornets, but also control the rhythm of the game, only to be killed by Graham. And today, a straight 18 point win!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/After the warriors are at the bottom, they don't calm down! Six games, three wins, back to the playoffs/4a2d05578ce94669b40f869ab4c7ee19.jpg" alt="After the warriors are at the bottom, they don&#39;t calm down! Six games, three wins, back to the playoffs"><br>Six games and three wins. If you are in the west, you are assigned to step back, but this is the East without desire and desire, and it is 7 places away! So after this war, the Knicks can at least get rid of the title of the bottom in the East and give up to the Wizards! And the Knicks 4-10 record, from the eighth hornet in the East, is only 3.5 games short. As long as they play well, they can still compete for tickets to the playoffs!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/After the warriors are at the bottom, they don't calm down!

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In the game between raptors and Clippers, in fact, raptors had a lead for a while, and Clippers had not established an absolute safe differential in the whole game.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Almost reversed! Cut 14 + 2 + 8 + 3 in 45 minutes. Raptor's leader said punish Leonard/63dfbdf999284305b51c59432ab106ba.jpg" alt="Almost reversed! Cut 14 + 2 + 8 + 3 in 45 minutes. Raptor&#39;s leader said punish Leonard"><br>In the first quarter of the game, the Raptors made Leonard not play smoothly at the beginning of the game through high-intensity defense, making his mistakes, putting pressure on him to defend and forcing him to give the ball to his teammates. Once Leonard didn’t hold the ball in the start of the clipper, the attack was basically a set of loose sand, so the clipper hit the iron crazily some time before the first quarter. After Leonard went down, Luwei It’s only when he comes up that the situation gets better. Because Luwei is a man who can’t be touched easily, can give him strength, can get on the body, but can’t get too close, especially in the process of conversion and in the process of pick-up and cover, so many of the attack of pick-up and cover, raptors didn’t attack Luwei too fiercely. He scored 21 points in 7 of 15 tonight, only 6 free throws in the whole field, which is also the comparison of raptors’ defense It’s coloured.<br>Siakam was also very tired. Leonard defended him in person on the front line. After that, there was Harrell on the inside line. Even if he started, zubates was on the court. Siakam couldn’t use his height and arms to show his breakthrough skills, plus back-to-back combat. He played for more than 42 minutes in two consecutive games. This time, he was tired. The last part of the game was crucial At the moment, when someone needs to score, he is invisible. In the last 12 minutes, he gets 3 points from 6-1, plus or minus - 15. It’s not that he doesn’t want to play, but that he puts too much energy into the defensive end, the whole court, the whole process to participate in the defense of Leonard. At the same time, he makes a fast break, and sikam can’t play.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Almost reversed! Cut 14 + 2 + 8 + 3 in 45 minutes. Raptor's leader said punish Leonard/dec8258be00648dbbfb7c04fd3f59052.jpg" alt="Almost reversed! Cut 14 + 2 + 8 + 3 in 45 minutes. Raptor&#39;s leader said punish Leonard"><br>The man who came out of the game was van fleet, but unfortunately he didn’t make it. Van Jordan played 45 minutes in this game, and only had a rest for 3 minutes in total. Raptors’ demand for van Jordan is obvious. Without Lori, the attack and organization of the outside line depend on him. 6 for 20 shots, 6 for 3-pointers, 1 for 6 shots, 14 points, 2 rebounds, 8 assists, 3 steals, plus or minus - 14. Although the data is not very good-looking, but at least van fleet has tried to stand up, in the west when Kam can not play, want to take responsibility, have to admire his aggressive spirit.<br>At the end of the last 12 minutes, fanfulit played the whole section, 7-for-1, got 2 points, 1 rebounds, 1 assists and 1 steals. In the game, when everyone is tired, the whole team is looking forward to van fleet to hold the ball and break through the basket, rather than standing outside. Although he has been blocked by Harrell for two consecutive layups, he has been hitting the forbidden area since no player is more confident than him except cicham. Who is going to stand out?<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Almost reversed! Cut 14 + 2 + 8 + 3 in 45 minutes. Raptor's leader said punish Leonard/2a0a5e0d502e4f7eb1616ed197747fc0.jpg" alt="Almost reversed! Cut 14 + 2 + 8 + 3 in 45 minutes. Raptor&#39;s leader said punish Leonard"><br>At the offensive end, van fleet did all he could, taking into account both scoring and organizational tasks. In the case of the fast ship’s front line and outside line defense, it’s good that he can play this data. It’s important to know that players of Leonard’s level can’t play for 34 minutes, only 11 shots and 9 mistakes. Compared with the substitute level of van fleet, van fleet’s level is better From the defender’s point of view, his overall performance is better than Leonard’s. What’s more, van fleet is also very good at the defensive end. Leonard has played van fleet for many times, but almost every positional battle is not so easy. Van fleet and his teammates have made mistakes for many times. Before Leonard is ready to attack, van fleet and his teammates go forward to attack. They don’t observe Leonard’s teammates’ positions and prepare to enter Opportunity to attack. With 45 minutes of high-intensity defense, confrontation and concentration, as well as continuous contribution on the offensive side, van fleet’s performance is really not black.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Almost reversed! Cut 14 + 2 + 8 + 3 in 45 minutes. Raptor's leader said punish Leonard/f79bd8e75fe54504ba20221a1e4140a2.jpg" alt="Almost reversed! Cut 14 + 2 + 8 + 3 in 45 minutes. Raptor&#39;s leader said punish Leonard"><br>At the end of the game, van Fleet said they had sanctioned Leonard. Despite losing the game, they made Leonard feel bad. To be fair, the Raptors did lose the game, but if there was no accident in the away battle, Ibaka and Lori were injured, anunobi was also injured, the three players would return, the strength of both ends of the attack and defense increased significantly, and no one could get points at the last critical moment, forcing fanfulit to challenge Harrell, the whole team only got 10 points. If Lori is here, it’s not the Clippers that are turning around. Maybe it’s the Raptors.<br>On the score, raptors lost, but I think in spirit and performance, raptors did not lose.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In an NBA regular season game that ended at noon on November 20, the king faced the sun at home. The sun just defeated Celtic in yesterday’s game, and Rubio was absent due to back spasm. In this game, Rubio returned, but the sun was defeated from the first quarter. In the last quarter, the sun made great efforts to catch up, but the difference was too big. 120-116, the king won a victory again, and the sun’s record after this battle was 7-6, which has been narrowed by the king!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Another black horse in the West! 8-6 upset the league and the Lakers survived/675286f6f561444a9532470fa1f6ffb5.jpg" alt="Another black horse in the West! 8-6 upset the league and the Lakers survived"><br>In terms of data, on the sun’s side, Debray scored 20 points and 8 rebounds, Kaminsky scored 17 points and 4 rebounds, Booker scored 30 points and 8 assists, Rubio scored 1 point in 7-0, and bridges scored 20 points and 5 rebounds. King’s side, Barnes 15 points, belica 17 points 8 rebounds, Holmes 20 points 15 rebounds, Hilde 12 points, Bogdanovic 31 points 7 assists.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Another black horse in the West! 8-6 upset the league and the Lakers survived/8cbc43b2cd9c4d1a9148b0e733eeb57c.jpg" alt="Another black horse in the West! 8-6 upset the league and the Lakers survived"><br>After the opening of the two teams are very iron, the king with Holmes to open the deadlock, and then berecha broke out with seven points in a row, taking this opportunity for the king to hit a wave of 16-4 attack climax. And the sun in Booker and Cameron Johnson under the leadership of the start, single 33-19! In the second quarter, Didier Damon’s shot, Barnes’s continuous inside score, Bogdan’s three consecutive fountainhead, the king once opened the difference to 19 points, and the sun rookie Johnson became a wonder soldier, after two three points in a row, the king led the sun 62-45 in half.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Another black horse in the West! 8-6 upset the league and the Lakers survived/8cef7aa1039f4ad89aa98edbc16e3dac.jpg" alt="Another black horse in the West! 8-6 upset the league and the Lakers survived"><br>In the third quarter, the king continued to expand his advantage by relying on berecha and Barnes’ three points in a row. The difference was once widened to 26 points, but buck even got 8 points to stop bleeding. The sun returned a wave of 15-5 climaxes. At the end of the third quarter, the king was still 12 points ahead. In the fourth quarter, the king and the sun started to score three points each other in the last four minutes. The king’s defense line was a bit of a crash, but fortunately, the score was set at 120-116 with a free throw!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Another black horse in the West! 8-6 upset the league and the Lakers survived/1e68ab3a406f48cd8b468532e18e674b.jpg" alt="Another black horse in the West! 8-6 upset the league and the Lakers survived"><br>In fact, Kenny Dalglish’s start of the new season is very bad, including Bagley and fox, who are still in the stage of recuperation, the team is not well staffed, Kenny Dalglish has experienced five consecutive defeats in the start, and Walton has also been questioned and criticized by various voices. In fact, the king’s foundation is not bad. Even though the two rookies can’t play, but including Bogdanovic, Hilde, Barnes and so on have already proved themselves. At this stage, the king’s game is full of toughness. After entering November, when eight games are played, he won six crazy games. There are many opponents such as jazz and Celtic. In the two lost games, he lost four points away Raptors, the other game is 2 points to lose the Lakers.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Another black horse in the West! 8-6 upset the league and the Lakers survived/2dbe89c1b07f416b8fb3e634c1393f12.jpg" alt="Another black horse in the West! 8-6 upset the league and the Lakers survived"><br>However, the referee’s report after the game of losing the Lakers showed that the referee made a penalty against the king in the last 5.5 seconds, James should have been an offensive foul, and the king is expected to kill the Lakers in the last moment. After the game, general Barnes helplessly said that the referee’s penalty cannot be changed, but he will definitely beat the Lakers next time.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Another black horse in the West! 8-6 upset the league and the Lakers survived/400ed50784774aa9a01e8f7409f40bb4.jpg" alt="Another black horse in the West! 8-6 upset the league and the Lakers survived"><br>Dalglish is now in a fierce situation. In the last game, he used Holmes’s free throw to kill Celtic, who has won 10 consecutive points, and successfully slowed down Celtic’s progress. This game has pulled down the biggest black horse sun since the start of the western competition. After this war, the king ranked ninth in the West with 6-7 record, but they have succeeded in catching up with the sun. In the future, the king will start a journey away from home, facing the nets, wizards, Celtics and 76 people in a row, which is more difficult. The trip will determine whether they can hold the top eight in the West and prove their strength.</p>

    <title>Another close victory! 38 minutes, 29 + 4 + 11 + 3 + 2, he beat the king 4 points in a row</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Kenny Dalglish challenges the Lakers away. There are many points to watch in this game. First of all, as the coach of the Lakers last season, Wharton will have what kind of performance in front of his former owners, and what tactical restrictions can he play for James? Second, will pop’s law be broken when he starts to play instead of Bradley? Theoretically speaking, King’s main force fox is injured, and the Lakers have great hopes of winning three consecutive games.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Another close victory! 38 minutes, 29 + 4 + 11 + 3 + 2, he beat the king 4 points in a row/96077ea841b6458c81162ed3e52dc650.jpg" alt="Another close victory! 38 minutes, 29 + 4 + 11 + 3 + 2, he beat the king 4 points in a row"><br>In the first quarter of the game, the Lakers had a good chance to appear, but the shooting percentage was not high, and the outside three-point goal didn’t hit, on the contrary, the king got more from the outside. After playing for less than 4 minutes, the Lakers replaced pop, because the king’s pressing for the serve was a bit fierce. If James held the ball for half-time, it would cost him energy, so Vogel replaced Caruso very early. In addition to controlling the ball, he also got a lot of mobile phone meetings, but three times in the three-point line, the Lakers are temporarily behind, and the dual core has yet to work.<br>After Rondo came up, the Lakers’ offense became more orderly when James was replaced. Coach long created a very comfortable shooting opportunity for other players of the Lakers, but the overall shooting rate of the Lakers was too low. In the first quarter, the free throw of the thick eyebrow started to be lost, and the last attack of the thick eyebrow also confirmed that his game condition was not very good. There was a deep impression that Rondo pointed to the outside line and asked Kuzma to move the ball out of the three-point line, but Kuzma ignored it and directly threw a big hook three non stick against the defense. If the Lakers play like this, coach long can’t help them! In the first quarter, the two teams played 20-30, and the Lakers were 10 points behind.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Another close victory! 38 minutes, 29 + 4 + 11 + 3 + 2, he beat the king 4 points in a row/5253bec0be2a4f789e3a13b8941f953a.jpg" alt="Another close victory! 38 minutes, 29 + 4 + 11 + 3 + 2, he beat the king 4 points in a row"><br>In the next quarter, the attack end of the Lakers didn’t improve, mainly because James didn’t play a big threat, and the rest didn’t play a good hand. Kuzma was also targeted by the king for his inefficient defense on the court, and the Lakers were suppressed in the difference of 10 points in 5 minutes, until Kuzma got 5 points in a row through three points and breakthrough, the attack of the Lakers was not improved A trend for improvement. Walton saw that the Lakers had a tendency to fight back and called for a pause, but not only failed to stop the Lakers, but the Lakers played a wave of 14-0 in five minutes.<br>In fact, in these five minutes, the inner lake talents got 14 points, the attack efficiency was not particularly high, but their defense was the most remarkable thing. Howard had a strong defense deterrent in the inner line. In addition, he had a very good effect in changing defense, making up defense, protecting the backboard in the back field and fighting for the backboard in the front field. James directly pasted on the front line to the other side, all of them were very positive Very hard. The Lakers played 29-20 in the second quarter, 50-49 at the end of the half.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Another close victory! 38 minutes, 29 + 4 + 11 + 3 + 2, he beat the king 4 points in a row/ac70b8714c26402da94c2a03560cc0f5.jpg" alt="Another close victory! 38 minutes, 29 + 4 + 11 + 3 + 2, he beat the king 4 points in a row"><br>In the third quarter of the game, the Lakers replaced pop and let Caruso play in the first half. Under the leadership of James and bushmei, the Lakers played a wave of 9-3, exceeding the difference to 5 points. The Lakers’ offensive fluency in this game has increased, mainly because of the ability of holding and controlling the ball by Caruso. He has a positive running position. He played with James in three consecutive rounds and scored 7 points in a row. The king relied on Bogdanovic’s difficult three points to keep the difference between six points.<br>In the last three minutes, James was off and Rondo came on to organize the attack. Without James as a strong point of attack, bushmei didn’t want to play singles in the low post, which was totally different from the usual bushmei, and the desire for attack was not very strong. The Lakers began to lose points, leading by only three points at the end of the third quarter, playing 74-71 with kings.<br>At the end of the game, James and Rondo led the substitutes, Howard continued to play in the inner line, the Lakers played well at both ends of the attack and defense, James even got 7 points a wave of attack climax to open the difference to 8 points. But king quickly changed his game, not playing outside, but playing inside. The Lakers were a little caught off guard and called for a timeout.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Another close victory! 38 minutes, 29 + 4 + 11 + 3 + 2, he beat the king 4 points in a row/5156c9e1e071438586b624d89df25764.jpg" alt="Another close victory! 38 minutes, 29 + 4 + 11 + 3 + 2, he beat the king 4 points in a row"><br>In the last five minutes of the last quarter, the Lakers put on James, bushbrow and Howard, or strengthened the defense and height of the inner line. Howard was able to defend the outer line when defending the pick and roll, giving a very high defensive aggressiveness. After the Lakers’ overall defense came out, it was easier to switch attack and defense. Pop seized the opportunity to score 7 points in a row at the critical moment, helping the Lakers to stabilize the situation. With two minutes left, James made a key mistake, and Bogdanovic scored seven points in a row to beat the Lakers. In the last minute, James scored 4 points through hard play, layup and free throw to help the Lakers build a two-point lead, leaving 5 seconds for the king. Finally, Barnes failed in the final kill, and the key cover of the bushbrow made a contribution.<br>The Lakers beat king 99-97 in the whole game. Although they won, it was another close win. The Lakers and many teams played close wins. They played close wins with bulls, lone Rangers, spurs, Suns and other teams. The difference was not big. They had to stick to it until the end. Only teams like warriors would have a big difference.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Another close victory! 38 minutes, 29 + 4 + 11 + 3 + 2, he beat the king 4 points in a row/23b6f34d9c7d422194f4928f056c8549.jpg" alt="Another close victory! 38 minutes, 29 + 4 + 11 + 3 + 2, he beat the king 4 points in a row"><br>James played 38 minutes in this game, made 10 of 20 shots, got 29 points, 4 rebounds, 11 assists, 3 steals, 2 mistakes, plus or minus value + 13. At the end of the game, James stood up to score to help the Lakers stabilize the situation, but the key mistake was not supposed to be. If the king’s final kill is successful, James’s mistake will be fatal.<br>Bogdanovic got 18 points, 3 rebounds, 5 assists and 2 steals in 36 minutes, which was also outstanding. Especially at the critical moment of the last quarter, he scored continuously to help the king to score, 3 points, 5 shots and 3 hits, and each of them was completed with high difficulty against the defense. If the king’s goal was set for him, maybe the outcome of the game would be different.</p>

    <title>Back to back two in a row! Cut 33 + 9 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 7 in 24 minutes. At the critical moment, he was killed by the pelican</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Clippers challenge pelicans away. The lineups of both teams are not complete. Although George’s first comeback is coming to the clippers, Leonard doesn’t play because the Clippers are back-to-back. It’s not the first time Leonard has taken a rest in this way. The Clippers put Luwei in the starting line up with George, which is also to reduce George’s holding pressure as much as possible. Pelican’s ball elder brother and Ingram can’t play, lack two main generals, especially Ingram such an attack core, want to beat the clipper, theoretically speaking, it’s a little difficult.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Back to back two in a row! Cut 33 + 9 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 7 in 24 minutes. At the critical moment, he was killed by the pelican/c1e2d3b13339472db4ae2b04e3f1fc9c.jpg" alt="Back to back two in a row! Cut 33 + 9 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 7 in 24 minutes. At the critical moment, he was killed by the pelican"><br>At the beginning of the game, George played a little slack at both ends of the attack and defense. The first score of this season was to hit in a counterattack by the Clippers using the European stepping board, but after playing for three minutes, he went down to rest. I don’t know why. Then the ball on the field is more concentrated in Luwei’s hands, and the Clippers play more smoothly. But the intensity of defense is not enough. The Clippers are not good at single defense or back defense. Maybe it’s because there’s no Beverly as the spiritual pillar on the court. The front line is also short of Leonard’s entanglement. The Clippers give the pelicans a lot of opportunities. Some young players play with the ball, and the success rate is still high.<br>In the last three minutes, when the two sides replaced the main force, George came back and finally understood rivers’ intention. The pelican’s second team has no offensive or defensive strength, and there’s no Wayne on the court, so George will play more easily and get the best results. Sure enough, after George came up, he made three shots and three shots, which perfectly explained what a top scorer is without a ball or with a ball. At the end of the first quarter, clippers and pelicans played 35-34.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Back to back two in a row! Cut 33 + 9 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 7 in 24 minutes. At the critical moment, he was killed by the pelican/8cb8149f22654657bfb384a9a64ed2f3.jpg" alt="Back to back two in a row! Cut 33 + 9 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 7 in 24 minutes. At the critical moment, he was killed by the pelican"><br>In the next quarter, George played on the court with the substitute. The Clippers let George attack almost every ball. The effect was very good. The pelican had no attack core, and the difference was 6 points. The game lasted three minutes and George was replaced before the main players came back. After Holliday came up, the pelican’s attack had organization points and scoring points. Favos and Moore scored three points, and the pelican gradually began to score points. In less than two minutes, the pelican scored three points against the super fast ship.<br>The clipper was overtaken by rivers without any tension, no request for a pause, and the defense was as lax as ever. Holliday scored three three-point goals in a row. The clipper didn’t show any sign, and the difference was quickly widened to 10 points. Pelican also has no defense, relying on the outside three-point ball to open the feel, and at the same time simply hit Dewey, did not expect to get a good effect, disrupted the fast ship’s attack. At the last three and a half minutes, George came back to the court, but after a round, he got his fourth foul and was replaced. At the end of the half-time, Pelican extended the difference to 13 points, and the two sides played 72-59. Pelican scored 72 points in the second half with the rest of the team, so what’s the level of defense of clippers. Holliday scored 24 points in 10 of 12 half-time.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Back to back two in a row! Cut 33 + 9 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 7 in 24 minutes.

At the critical moment, he was killed by the pelican"><br>In the third quarter, George and the starting line-up increased their defensive strength after returning to the field, making some mistakes except pelican, reducing their hit rate, making a wave of attack climax, reducing the difference to 5 points. After more than 4 minutes, George was replaced. The clipper and Pelican made a climax of attack in the next period of time, but the clipper suppressed pelican in the momentum, because Holliday had never opened this point, and the difference was up and down within 2 points.<br>In the last three minutes of the third quarter, Ludwig had a rest, George came on to lead the team, came up and played a wave of Pelican attacks, and the difference was more than 3 points. But George soon got his fifth foul and was forced to change. Although the Clippers did not lack rotation players, Luwei could come up and lead the team, but it might have an impact on George’s playing time and performance in the last quarter. At the end of the third quarter, pelican and clipper played 96-97, with clipper leading 1 point.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Back to back two in a row! Cut 33 + 9 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 7 in 24 minutes. At the critical moment, he was killed by the pelican/833486c8580e4c2a88401d8ed85a7775.jpg" alt="Back to back two in a row! Cut 33 + 9 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 7 in 24 minutes. At the critical moment, he was killed by the pelican"><br>At the end of the game, the two sides fought a wave of counter attack, and the two sides entered the period of alternating lead. The pelican can score, but the only thing that isn’t explosive enough is that Holliday hasn’t turned it on. George came back to the court with seven minutes left, but the effect was not very good. His physical fitness may be affected. In addition, in the face of the pelican’s most defensible player, Holliday, George made two mistakes in three attacks.<br>In the last four minutes of the last quarter, the main players of both sides returned to the field. George was defended by Holliday twice in a row. Instead, Holliday played two waves of counterattack attacks, exceeding the score to 4 points, and then shot three points against the defense. A person scored eight points in a row to help the pelican establish a safer lead. George continued his personal attack at the critical moment, but when he dribbled the ball to the low position, he was cut off by holliday. In turn, Holliday and fevos cooperated to play twice, and the difference was 6 points, leaving only 48 seconds for the Clippers. In the end, the Clippers failed to reverse the game, and the two sides played 132-127.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Back to back two in a row! Cut 33 + 9 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 7 in 24 minutes.

At the critical moment, he was killed by the pelican"><br>In the whole game, George played 24 minutes, 10 of 17 shots, 5 of 3 pointers, 3 of 5 free throws, 10 of 10 free throws, 33 points, 9 rebounds, 4 assists, 5 mistakes, 5 fouls, plus or minus 7. It seems that George’s efficiency is very high, but in fact, it’s because the pelican’s defense is very poor, and George spent most of his time playing with the pelican’s second team, and once against Holliday, George’s success rate will be greatly reduced. After the last loss to the Rockets, the Clippers came to two consecutive defeats.<br>On the pelican side, Holliday played 36 minutes, 13 of 24 shots, 7 of 3-pointers, 5 of 7 shots, 36 points, 4 rebounds, 7 assists, 6 steals, 1 block and 7 mistakes. In the second quarter, the pelican relied on Holliday’s three-point ball to establish a leading position, and also relied on Holliday’s three-point ball and defense to stabilize the difference in the last quarter.</p>

    <title>Another crackdown! Cut 37 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 in 20 minutes. The eagle can&#39;t prevent him</title>
    <url>/2019/11/17/Another%20crackdown!%20Cut%2037%20+%204%20+%203%20+%202%20+%201%20+%203%20in%2020%20minutes.%20The%20eagle%20can&#39;t%20prevent%20him/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Clippers host the eagles. George made his debut in staples, but Leonard didn’t play. The official announcement was that he was injured, so there was still no fighting power of the clipper twins in this game. The real strength of the clipper is still in a “secret” state. The eagles are not a strong team. With George getting used to the intensity of the game, in theory, this game should be a good chance for them to end their losing streak.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Another crackdown! Cut 37 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 in 20 minutes. The eagle can't prevent him/8651dfc1d5b4476894f15b74d4248401.jpg" alt="Another crackdown! Cut 37 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 in 20 minutes. The eagle can&#39;t prevent him"><br>In the first quarter, because the Clippers didn’t put Dewey on the court, George became the only attacking core of the team at the beginning. The Clippers played a good attacking state at the beginning of the game, and gave treyang a lot of defensive pressure at the defensive end. After the score was played for two and a half minutes, the eagle called a pause. However, the suspension did not delay the fast ship’s offensive momentum. George continued to maintain an efficient attack. Trey young continued to be targeted defense. The eagle’s hit rate was not high. In less than half a quarter, the fast ship pulled the difference to 17 points.<br>George played for five minutes to rest and got 15 points, plus or minus + 15. After the clipper came up as a substitute, Trey young once found the offensive state. He gradually approached the difference by looking for his teammates. However, after two consecutive three-point pitches of super wave, the eagle began to have problems in the attack. The continuous scores of Luwei and Harrell helped the clipper stabilize its advantage. At the end of the first section, the two sides played 43-30.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Another crackdown! Cut 37 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 in 20 minutes. The eagle can't prevent him/0219a2a7d9614e7ca73d95bbbf90f5f4.jpg" alt="Another crackdown! Cut 37 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 in 20 minutes. The eagle can&#39;t prevent him"><br>In the second quarter, Rowe, Harrell and George were on the court at the same time, and the problem suddenly exposed. George has become the second attack point, or even the third attack point of the team. The ball is completely in the hands of Luwei. There is no connection with George. George has become a point to open space. 3D players are right. The Clippers didn’t start the game well. The Hawks seized the opportunity to close the gap to 7 points.<br>After rivers adjusted the lineup to change Dewey, George’s holding round increased, and the clipper’s attack was activated in an instant. In addition to the attack defense conversion, George took the ball and hit the inside and outside three-point ball to catch the jump shot, and then opened the difference of four points to 16 points. George went down to rest with three minutes left. It was the chance of the eagles, but Trey Young’s attack was terrible. The eagles also made a lot of mistakes and failed to seize the chance. At the end of half-time, clippers and eagles played 74-62.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Another crackdown! Cut 37 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 in 20 minutes. The eagle can't prevent him/9a627bd57f104fe486fe1b3287bb0cd6.jpg" alt="Another crackdown! Cut 37 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 in 20 minutes. The eagle can&#39;t prevent him"><br>In the third quarter, George led the starting line-up to continue to help the Clippers to score points, with or without the ball, such as chopping melons and cutting vegetables, and the eagles did not have a defender who could match George. After the Clippers came on the bench, they continued to suppress the eagles, and the maximum difference was opened to 19 points. The hawk doesn’t have a three-point ball, and the defense is not very good. It’s hard to chase points just because Trey young is an attacking point. Once it’s limited to this point, and then he defends the inside line, the Hawk has no engine. The attack is in trouble, and it’s hard to score, let alone chase points. At the end of the third quarter, the two sides played 82-112, with the Hawks 30 points behind.<br>In the fourth quarter, with the Clippers 30 points ahead, George still had to play. I don’t know what rivers meant. Two minutes later, the Clippers had a 30 point lead, and George ended the game after giving Harrell a kicking assist. In the end, the two sides reached 101-150.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Another crackdown! Cut 37 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 in 20 minutes. The eagle can't prevent him/4fd774788fa6458dbdd36d80fdcf3b6d.jpg" alt="Another crackdown! Cut 37 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 in 20 minutes. The eagle can&#39;t prevent him"><br>In the whole game, George only played 20 minutes, made 10 of 17 shots, 6 of 3-pointer 11, 11 of free throw 11, got 37 points, 4 rebounds, 3 assists, 2 steals, 1 block, 3 mistakes, plus or minus value + 28. In the last first show, he played 24 minutes and got 33 points. In this game, he got more points in less time. George’s lethality is too great. When Leonard returns, it’s a good combination Can overturn the whole league! Of course, the hawks and pelicans are not very good defense, George in the defense of a good team such as the Lakers, jazz, raptors, perhaps is the real test of strength.<br>On the eagles’ side, Trey young played 28 minutes, made 4 of 16 shots, 2 of 7 3-pointers, got 20 points, 5 rebounds, 6 assists and 1 steals. That’s not to say that Trey young couldn’t move. In fact, he didn’t play well himself. In the face of high-intensity defense, he was a bit flustered. His teammates were not as strong as clippers. Trey young played like this. It was no surprise that the eagles lost the game.</p>

    <title>Blow out the Clippers! The second lowest showdown in the west, with warriors in the first place and 14 other teams in the first place</title>
    <url>/2019/11/17/Blow%20out%20the%20Clippers!%20The%20second%20lowest%20showdown%20in%20the%20west,%20with%20warriors%20in%20the%20first%20place%20and%2014%20other%20teams%20in%20the%20first%20place/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Beijing time on November 15, the end of the noon NBA regular season, Pelican home against clipper, Leonard truce, pickled peppers return, the performance is very good, the process of the game is surprising, the pelican slashed 72 points in the first half, the third quarter of the power outage, and to the fourth quarter of the critical moment, Holliday stood out to take 8 points, the clipper suddenly died! 132-127, pelicans won their third victory since the start of the new season, but it was this victory that allowed them to officially show their cards to the outside world: we are not at the same level as warriors!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Blow out the Clippers! The second lowest showdown in the west, with warriors in the first place and 14 other teams in the first place/ea930f2bcfd74da2b1f2aa150743afdd.jpg" alt="Blow out the Clippers! The second lowest showdown in the west, with warriors in the first place and 14 other teams in the first place"><br>In terms of data, on the clipper side, Paojiao has 33 points and 9 rebounds, Harrell has 18 points and 6 rebounds and 6 assists, Luwei has 29 points and 8 assists, and McGraw has 20 points and 6 rebounds. Pelican side, Moore 15 points, favos 20 points 20 rebounds (9 front court), Redick 17 points 3 assists, Holliday 35 points 7 assists 4 rebounds, substitute Jackson also has 23 points 5 rebounds.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Blow out the Clippers! The second lowest showdown in the west, with warriors in the first place and 14 other teams in the first place/8cabe191204b4d88a58774fc34d86328.jpg" alt="Blow out the Clippers! The second lowest showdown in the west, with warriors in the first place and 14 other teams in the first place"><br>Yingge truce, Qiuge truce and okafu truce, originally lacking Zion, pelican is really a set of substitutes, but from the beginning, Pelican showed a strong offensive firepower, Moore and Holliday were in full bloom, both sides got stuck after pickled peppers hit the first ball, while pelican’s outside line feel is very hot, Redick, Jackson and Holliday hit three points in a row, Section I 34-35. In the second quarter, the pelican continued to rain three points after a short period of depression, and favos and Moore made consecutive hits. Holliday added three more points to the score, unconsciously the pelican opened the difference, half-time 72-59. Holliday scored 24 points in the half!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Blow out the Clippers! The second lowest showdown in the west, with warriors in the first place and 14 other teams in the first place/62555b1aea064961b3776a5da4586184.jpg" alt="Blow out the Clippers! The second lowest showdown in the west, with warriors in the first place and 14 other teams in the first place"><br>In the third quarter, the pelican once fell into a depression, while Paojiao took this opportunity to lead the team to play a wave of 9-2 climax to narrow the difference, then Harrell and megrood fought continuously, both sides fell into a deadlock, and the third quarter ended the clipper 97-96 Pelican. The most critical fourth quarter, Jackson’s three points after a wave of 6-0 climax, then Harrell won 4 points, and the last moment Holliday 2 three points + 2 free throws, directly open the difference, and Jackson’s three points completely killed the game, the score set at 132-127!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Blow out the Clippers! The second lowest showdown in the west, with warriors in the first place and 14 other teams in the first place/64683d1ee7af4921bc712ec16576b2f4.jpg" alt="Blow out the Clippers! The second lowest showdown in the west, with warriors in the first place and 14 other teams in the first place"><br>Terrible! To know that even if the Clippers don’t have Leonard, this set of last season’s playoff lineup plus a healthy pickled peppers is at least the top level in the West. In this game, pickled peppers perform well, and Luwei has made a continuous breakthrough to the pelican’s interior line to kill, but the most important point is that Holliday has blasted the clipper’s man! Beverly’s absence makes rivers unavailable in the guard position, which is the biggest problem for the Clippers at present. It’s hard to understand that the Clippers continuously let Holliday and Jackson shoot three points in the fourth quarter. Do you despise the pelican?<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Blow out the Clippers! The second lowest showdown in the west, with warriors in the first place and 14 other teams in the first place/0a2a9f9886bf4fb8b45420ac30179caf.jpg" alt="Blow out the Clippers! The second lowest showdown in the west, with warriors in the first place and 14 other teams in the first place"><br>Since the start of the game, pelicans have won three games in total, including nuggets, Hornets and Clippers. In the middle, with Yingge’s absence and comeback, brother Qiu’s absence and Zion’s absence, the lineup has always been incomplete. But in the eight games they lost, none of them lost more than 10 points! In other words, they often end up with rivals, no matter who they are, no matter what their squad is. This pelican is not without strength. Compared with the previous summer’s playoff game against warriors, it just went through the thick eyebrows and Rondo, while the likes of Holliday, Moore and others are still there. Besides, the team and fevos are in the inner line. Redick feels hot, and their strength is OK.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Blow out the Clippers! The second lowest showdown in the west, with warriors in the first place and 14 other teams in the first place/bd20ef0ed34a40de9ae4d89b34795b01.jpg" alt="Blow out the Clippers! The second lowest showdown in the west, with warriors in the first place and 14 other teams in the first place"><br>Showdown! Does the pelican look like the second from the bottom of the west? I believe that with the return of Yingge and the return of Qiuge, their running in will gradually take shape, and they will never fall to the second lowest position in the west, even without Zion. In this way, if the western region is divided into different grades according to its strength, the first 14 branches are in the first gear, and the warriors should be in the only gear. On November 18, pelicans and warriors faced each other head-on. The last time the warriors had Kuri, the warriors narrowly beat pelicans. As for the competition after three days, we will see!</p>

    <title>Boom 24 + 14 + 8! Only a year later, East Hickey opened the gap, and little Jarun left in frustration after the game</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the lone ranger field defeated the Grizzlies 138-122. At present, the lone ranger regular season starts with four consecutive wins away from home. This is the second time in 40 seasons in the history of lone Rangers that they have won 4 consecutive away games since the beginning of the season. It has to be said that the lone ranger is really making money in choosing Luca Dongqi. He is really a perfect foundation for team building. And today, in the absence of polzingis due to injury, the lone ranger easily won the victory. Under the leadership of dongqiqi, the lone ranger was all soldiers, and 8 people scored double. The only regret is that Morant, the top player of the year, is suspended this year.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Boom 24 + 14 + 8! Only a year later, East Hickey opened the gap, and little Jarun left in frustration after the game/05e32247b5904a10b6fca66103b30f5b.jpg" alt="Boom 24 + 14 + 8! Only a year later, East Hickey opened the gap, and little Jarun left in frustration after the game"><br>But Grizzlies still have little Jarun Jackson in town, but the gap between the rookie and Dongqi is too obvious. We all know that young Jarun Jackson and dongqiqi are both 18 time rookies, and their draft ranking is not much different. Dongqiqi is the third rookie in the first round of 2018, while little Jarun Jackson is the fourth rookie in the first round of 2018, with only one ranking difference between the two sides. However, dongqiqi’s performance will undoubtedly finish the rookie. Dongqiqi has become a superstar. This year, he is only a sophomore.<br>Young Jarun Jackson is still a battle force, not even reaching the all star level. Of course, today’s data gap between little Jarun Jackson and East Church is not obvious.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Boom 24 + 14 + 8! Only a year later, East Hickey opened the gap, and little Jarun left in frustration after the game/a1f56c5eb67d436eb7e6d5c0a85720ab.jpg" alt="Boom 24 + 14 + 8! Only a year later, East Hickey opened the gap, and little Jarun left in frustration after the game"><br>Dongqiqi scored 24 points, 14 boards, 8 assists, three pairs of data, shooting for 16 in 9, three points for 6 in 2. Little Jarun Jackson scored 23 points, 2 assists and 4 rebounds, shooting 10 of 17. If you look at the data, you can see a season’s data. Little Jarun can’t even see the tail light of dongqiqi’s car.<br>Last season, dongqiqi rookie averaged 21.2 points, 7.8 boards and 6 assists, while little Jarun rookie averaged 13.8 points, 4.7 boards. This season, the gap between the two is even more obvious. Dongqiqi raised the score to 27.7 points and got 10.8 boards and 9.1 assists, all of which are about to average three pairs per game. On the contrary, the data of little Jarun is lower than that of last year, with an average of 12.9 points and 5 boards per game.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Boom 24 + 14 + 8! Only a year later, East Hickey opened the gap, and little Jarun left in frustration after the game/46ff162da2014637a5bf2ddd5b3cfa97.jpg" alt="Boom 24 + 14 + 8! Only a year later, East Hickey opened the gap, and little Jarun left in frustration after the game"><br>In just a year, he has been widened by Dongqi, and it is very obvious. In terms of influence on the court, dongqiqi also crushed small Jarun. Today, in addition to Grizzlies suppressing the lone ranger in the first quarter, the other three quarters were beaten by the lone ranger. Especially in the second half, dongqiqi scored 5 points at the beginning of the game and led the lone ranger team to a 10-2 climax.<br>Later, when Grizzlies were chasing points, dongqiqi calmly responded, from scoring to holding in series. This gives Lone Ranger a 13 point lead in the third quarter. At the end of the day, when Grizzlies fought back, Dongqi led the team to play against them. After all, lone ranger has an advantage. Dongqi really has a handle on the situation on the field.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Boom 24 + 14 + 8! Only a year later, East Hickey opened the gap, and little Jarun left in frustration after the game/52fe625844d043ac84707dcc65bd16ac.jpg" alt="Boom 24 + 14 + 8! Only a year later, East Hickey opened the gap, and little Jarun left in frustration after the game"><br>In the past, we all know the three fakes of Texas, one team is strong, the Mavericks are weak and the Spurs are old. But over the past few years it has become a reality. After the lone ranger won the championship, Nowitzki’s strength declined and aged. Lone ranger can’t make it to the playoffs, but it’s good luck for them to be kind to the team. They didn’t give up wade like the heat, Celtic sold Pierce.<br>The lone ranger makes Nowitzki a good ending, but dongqiqi is a gift to repay the lone ranger.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Boom 24 + 14 + 8!

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In an NBA regular season game ending at noon on November 19, the Clippers won 90-88 at home, saved themselves by the final three points of pickled peppers, and defeated the thunder by the Clippers in a thrilling way and won two consecutive victories by the old rivers’ fierce confrontation with the referee! In fact, many players of the Clippers played badly in this game, like rookie man, who couldn’t even get in the empty jump shot, like huckles, who didn’t dare to vote at all, like pickled peppers, who made seven mistakes in the whole game and scored just as well, that’s to say, won’t the Lakers fans be depressed?<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Boom 28 + 12! It's the envy of the Lakers. He didn't pick the right one. Only the Clippers in the league can do this/13f371927e2d4924930e4f5876044a8e.jpg" alt="Boom 28 + 12! It&#39;s the envy of the Lakers. He didn&#39;t pick the right one. Only the Clippers in the league can do this"><br>In fact, the most discontented thing about clippers is that Leonard’s endless truce, although the strength of clippers has been damaged, it seems that they are not afraid! So far, Leonard has had five games off. He was understandably short of jazz and bucks, but he has been missing pelicans, eagles and thunder since last Thursday’s game. Three reasons for three games: back to back truce, load management, left knee contusion. The reason is like perfunctory League: We Leonard really can’t play, what do you want us to do? According to old rivers, he was 99% likely to play today, but it’s the Clippers.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Boom 28 + 12! It's the envy of the Lakers. He didn't pick the right one. Only the Clippers in the league can do this/2c29d8b4d5674c2db0ffd1f2cf2fdf4c.jpg" alt="Boom 28 + 12! It&#39;s the envy of the Lakers. He didn&#39;t pick the right one. Only the Clippers in the league can do this"><br>So, when the truce continued, when the pickled peppers were caught, and the continuous error state was depressed, someone came out of the clipper again. Harrell, today, he threw up Adams, the king of the card, as a rebounder in the front court, the rebounds in the front court today are 0! And Harrell grabbed eight rebounds on Adams’s head!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Boom 28 + 12! It's the envy of the Lakers. He didn't pick the right one. Only the Clippers in the league can do this/e5893bc848a44a35a44f1a1c746ef70b.jpg" alt="Boom 28 + 12! It&#39;s the envy of the Lakers. He didn&#39;t pick the right one. Only the Clippers in the league can do this"><br>Harrell’s bravery is mainly in the fourth quarter, 7 in single section 9. As long as the ball passed by Wayne, Harrell will be able to put the ball into the basket, no matter what way: pick the basket, explode the basket and snap the buckles, play the board and get strong under the basket. Harrell contributes 14 points, 7 rebounds, 2 assists, 1 block, 1 steals and 28 points, 12 rebounds, 5 assists in the whole game! It must be noted that today, Lu Wei only got 11 points and 9 assists, 11 points less than his regular season average level. He only saw that Harrell felt hot and fed Harrell. Lu Wei is the main player who can contribute 22.1 + 6.0 per game. In other words, even if the Clippers don’t have small cards, they are still far higher than many teams in the League!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Boom 28 + 12! It's the envy of the Lakers. He didn't pick the right one. Only the Clippers in the league can do this/a953eef0c8f3415baaec058330bc296e.jpg" alt="Boom 28 + 12! It&#39;s the envy of the Lakers. He didn&#39;t pick the right one. Only the Clippers in the league can do this"><br>There are four clippers with an average of more than 15 points this season. There are two teams in the league that can do this. The Celtics in the East, the Clippers in the West and the Lakers can’t reach this level. But Celtic’s Hayward has been injured, so the Clippers are the only one. Paojiao field average 29.3 + 6.7 + 3.7, Leonard field average 26.8 + 8.9 + 6, Luwei field average 22.1 + 3.8 + 6, Harrell field average 18.9 + 7.4 + 2.6! And rivers put two of them on the bench, even if the pickled peppers are not afraid of the downturn, then what is afraid of the absence of xiaoka?<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Boom 28 + 12! It's the envy of the Lakers. He didn't pick the right one. Only the Clippers in the league can do this/358ae209144744fc9918e3d39d5187fd.jpg" alt="Boom 28 + 12! It&#39;s the envy of the Lakers. He didn&#39;t pick the right one. Only the Clippers in the league can do this"><br>Looking back on the situation when he joined the clippers, after the Clippers established the framework combination of Luwei + Harrell + Beverly, and after the pickled peppers were sure to come together in Los Angeles, he finally went home. He came to the Clippers on the basis of a lot of thinking. Los Angeles is his hometown. The team has a certain competitiveness. Although the Lakers can, but he has different identities and comes first. Only clippers: the bottom line is also the playoff level, not to mention the addition of pickled peppers!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Boom 28 + 12! It's the envy of the Lakers. He didn't pick the right one. Only the Clippers in the league can do this/33f00f90ff964caf9bf9576a3da48aa9.jpg" alt="Boom 28 + 12! It&#39;s the envy of the Lakers. He didn&#39;t pick the right one. Only the Clippers in the league can do this"><br>And now the biggest wish of little card is to play in the playoffs. His value will only be maximized in the playoffs. At that time, the Clippers will make many fans despair. Xiao Ka is right. As long as the clippers can do this in the whole league, and they have done so since November!</p>

    <title>Boom 30 + 7 no savior! Russell&#39;s face is blue after the game, admit it, you just can&#39;t play green</title>
    <url>/2019/11/10/Boom%2030%20+%207%20no%20savior!%20Russell&#39;s%20face%20is%20blue%20after%20the%20game,%20admit%20it,%20you%20just%20can&#39;t%20play%20green/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Golden State Warriors lost again. They lost 108-114 to thunder on the road. They finished at the bottom of the league. Today in the third quarter warriors had a wave of 41-24 offensive frenzy, but ultimately did not complete the reversal. Russell must have done his best. He played 34 minutes, made 10 of 19 shots, got 30 points, 3 rebounds, 7 assists and 2 steals. After the game Russell left in dismay, looking lonely.<br>No one would have guessed that joining the warriors would make Russell suffer. He had come to lie down and win, but now he has become the new leader of the league. It’s worth mentioning that in the last game Russell faced the Timberwolves, with 52 points, 9 rebounds and 5 assists, Russell scored 82 points, 12 assists and 12 rebounds in two games.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Boom 30 + 7 no savior! Russell's face is blue after the game, admit it, you just can't play green/b76c00d226464dcea905783fedcaa114.jpg" alt="Boom 30 + 7 no savior! Russell&#39;s face is blue after the game, admit it, you just can&#39;t play green"><br>Despite Russell’s surging average points this season, he just can’t win. It even affected Russell’s reputation. Because the outside world won’t care how many configurations your warriors have, or how many superstars you lack. As long as Russell is a backer, he can not win is not a qualified team building cornerstone.<br>Russell’s heart is bitter. It’s like a meeting. Green + curry + Thompson, the three big brothers of warriors, suddenly left the table secretly, leaving Russell alone to be criticized. And Russell now has a good hand in the data. Maybe he will be traded next year.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Boom 30 + 7 no savior! Russell's face is blue after the game, admit it, you just can't play green/755d6de20b934c4985dcc82fd9702b46.jpg" alt="Boom 30 + 7 no savior! Russell&#39;s face is blue after the game, admit it, you just can&#39;t play green"><br>In the final analysis, Russell can’t connect with Curie seamlessly. The warrior’s backcourt is more suitable for Curie or Thompson, who has no ball. His defense can also wipe Curie’s ass. Russell and Curie are not good at defense. They are two targets in themselves, and one target is enough.<br>When Russell was interviewed after today’s game, his face was gray and his eyes were blank. When it comes to losing, Russell is simply saying something like chicken soup Wen, what will try to get the team back on track and so on, but who will believe these words?<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Boom 30 + 7 no savior! Russell's face is blue after the game, admit it, you just can't play green/252813444809469e918cdd1ac8849c86.jpg" alt="Boom 30 + 7 no savior! Russell&#39;s face is blue after the game, admit it, you just can&#39;t play green"><br>I can only say it’s Green’s wit, after Curie’s injury. The outside world is expecting what kind of data green will produce, because green has been very domineering in the past few years. Even scolded Durant, which makes people want to see how much weight he has. Is it a system player? As a result, green didn’t give the chance, and the ligament of finger was suddenly injured far away from the meeting site. He won Russell again. Is green really hurt or not? It must be a real injury, so it shows that green is very lucky.<br>“Before you came, we won the championship,” Green said to Durant Now green can say to Russell, “I was injured before you were injured * *.”<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Boom 30 + 7 no savior! Russell's face is blue after the game, admit it, you just can't play green/150ef087f97d43cb95c9d8ffbafbf307.jpg" alt="Boom 30 + 7 no savior! Russell&#39;s face is blue after the game, admit it, you just can&#39;t play green"><br>It seems a very wise decision to leave Russell with this mess. Russell is more like a mercenary. Remember what general manager miles said when the warriors got Russell this summer? One of the conditions for warriors not to trade Russell for a front line is that he has to be seamlessly connected with Kuri and the warrior system. This is a foreshadowing left by miles at that time, and now it is coming true.<br>Let Russell lead the team to get a high ranking draft, preferably in the top four. In this way, the warriors will take off when Russell, who has already scratched out high data, trades for a qualified front line next summer.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Boom 30 + 7 no savior! Russell's face is blue after the game, admit it, you just can't play green/8814ef673d204675b6e291656e64f000.jpg" alt="Boom 30 + 7 no savior! Russell&#39;s face is blue after the game, admit it, you just can&#39;t play green"><br>Curie + Thompson + new frontline + Green + Rooney start five tigers, coupled with high ranking rookies, warriors directly revived. It will be competitive in the next five years, and it can arrange the successor for Curie in advance.<br>As Cole said after today’s game, he doesn’t know what the warriors will do, but he only hopes that the warriors will not abandon themselves or win some games. Cole’s meaning is self-evident. I agree, but it’s better not to be too bad.</p>

Butler&#39;s eyes were tearful after the game in the past, I got high marks, we must lose"><br>Butler is excited after today’s game and believes joining the heat is a wise decision. Butler also apologized publicly for his high score. Because the coach coach coach before the game had suggested Butler to increase aggression, but Butler was a little afraid. Because in the past, when Butler scored high points, the team usually lost, which made Butler think that it was selfish to destroy the team.<br>“As long as I get high marks, I will feel guilty and blame myself,” Butler said. Because in the past when I got high marks, we usually couldn’t win. But before today’s game, I played more aggressively because I didn’t like it because I knew I could score. But for the teams I’ve been with before, we’ll lose whenever I score. But it’s different here * *. “<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Boom 35 + 4!

Butler&#39;s eyes were tearful after the game in the past, I got high marks, we must lose"><br>After Butler finished, he still had tears in his eyes. No matter in the bull or the wolf, Butler did not meet bole. Even in the 76ers, Butler’s team will lose as long as he gets high scores, while the heat Butler can score at will, which has no impact. For the first time in eight years, Butler was so happy.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the Mavericks lost 102-106 at home to the Knicks. Luka dongqiqi worked hard in this game. He played for 35 minutes, got 38 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists in three pairs, shooting 13 of 26. Polzingis played 35 minutes, with 28 points, 9 rebounds and 5 covers in 11 of 22 shots. The lone ranger duo must have tried their best, but such a performance doesn’t help the team win the game.<br>At the end of the day, he was a little too reliant on the three pointer. People say that dongqiqi’s play is a bit like James Harden’s, but fans don’t like dongqiqi’s complete magic ball play. They have to work hard in the middle distance.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Boom 38 + 14 over James! After the dongqiqi match, he apologized publicly, and Poseidon also grabbed the pot/02356898eee3413da8fdcb734db29e94.jpg" alt="Boom 38 + 14 over James! After the dongqiqi match, he apologized publicly, and Poseidon also grabbed the pot"><br>Look at Leonard on the clipper. His middle distance is really a weapon for killing people. There’s LeBron James of the Lakers. He’s also a killer in the back and back singles. Especially in the critical moment and playoffs, the middle distance is the most stable scoring method. Of course, dongqiqi’s performance is excellent today. In the first nine minutes, he made 11 points and 5 assists, becoming the perfect attack engine for the lone ranger.<br>In the second quarter, dongqiqi continued to score 8 points, while Posen scored 12 points in a single quarter, from three points to the middle distance, to play 2 + 1 under the basket. Lone ranger Gemini is hot.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Boom 38 + 14 over James! After the dongqiqi match, he apologized publicly, and Poseidon also grabbed the pot/1fc4b112bc0a46aa9643852dbabf89dd.jpg" alt="Boom 38 + 14 over James! After the dongqiqi match, he apologized publicly, and Poseidon also grabbed the pot"><br>Only in the second half, Morris blew up. When Posen started the big kill mode, little Morris started the day day mode. He hit three points in a row. He shot indiscriminately to lead the Knicks to 13 point advantage. Dongqiqi was also calm. In the last two minutes of the three quarters, he led the team to play a wave of 8-0 points, close to 4 points. At the end of the game, brenson and Posen played a 10-3 start, and the lone ranger once surpassed the score.<br>But it’s Maurice again. He’s like a ghost. Every time the lone ranger gets up, he puts out the fire by three points. In the last 25 seconds, the lone Rangers have the chance to play overtime. They chase to 102-105! And immediately to Gibson foul, he missed two, but the last three points of dongqiqi cell phone will not be good.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Boom 38 + 14 over James! After the dongqiqi match, he apologized publicly, and Poseidon also grabbed the pot/218974f0157a46ed8455d4787dc4b66b.jpg" alt="Boom 38 + 14 over James! After the dongqiqi match, he apologized publicly, and Poseidon also grabbed the pot"><br>38 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists. East Hickey today surpassed LeBron James as the NBA’s biggest Under-21 30 + triple double player (3 times), previously held by James (2 times). But such a record doesn’t make sense.<br>After today’s game, dongqiqi’s face was livid and very unwilling. He apologized publicly to the lone ranger for hurting the team.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Boom 38 + 14 over James!

After the dongqiqi match, he apologized publicly, and Poseidon also grabbed the pot"><br>“At the end of the day, I made a bad decision. It wasn’t an opportunity I wanted to look for. I apologize. I let the team down again today,” said donich<br>However, compared with Dongqi today, Posen is the most unhappy player. After all, there is a dispute between Knicks and him. Posen wants to win the game today and face Knicks aggressively. It’s a pity that Poseidon was attacked by Nix. In the past, Nix lost in a row. I didn’t expect to win in front of Poseidon today. I can only say that there is a destiny in the dark.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Boom 38 + 14 over James!

After the dongqiqi match, he apologized publicly, and Poseidon also grabbed the pot"><br>For dongqiqi’s apology, Posen also rushed to the back of the pot: “tonight, facing the old boss [Nix], I only made a little progress than before. It’s a pity that we didn’t win the game. We are all not playing well. We need to reflect on ourselves. “</p>

Adelaide is basically unstoppable, all kinds of medium distance hits hit the thunder is routed. Despite being 34 years old, Adelaide is still in excellent physical condition. Compared with Chris Paul, who is also 34 years old, Adelaide is definitely in better form than Paul. Some fans said that Paul played very well today, but compared with Adelaide, who is also 34 years old, Paul’s ability to tackle difficulties has declined too much.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Boom 39 + 6!

He scored four points on two mid-range hits in a row. To help the Spurs to chase points, at the end of the festival, Adelaide was even more crazy, returning to the state of shooting pretty guys in the pioneer era, playing the thunder basket. No matter who can’t stop Adelaide, the Spurs have already closed the gap of 7 points to 1 in half time. The score was 56-57.<br>Adriano scored 19 points in the first half, but his performance was not over. In the second half, Adelaide went crazy again.

After the game, Paul hugged Duncan Popovich and left.<br>Before the game, Paul took the initiative to say hello to Duncan when he was warming up on the sidelines, and they had a chat.

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended earlier, the Los Angeles Lakers beat the bulls 118-112 away for six straight wins. At present, it has ascended the first throne in the West. It’s not easy for the Lakers to win six games in a row for the second time after the 10-11 season. It can only be said that Zijin Dynasty has been silent for a long time. They have not been able to reach the playoffs in the past few seasons. Now the Lakers have been waking up, especially their offensive and defensive level began to give the fans a feeling, it seems that the Lakers are no matter how many points behind, they can all recover by defense.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Caruso, I shouldn't have hit you! James made a public apology after the game/e32c88764df744dba7f52312723c9006.jpg" alt="Caruso, I shouldn&#39;t have hit you! James made a public apology after the game"><br>And the atmosphere of the team is wonderful. Yesterday’s performance at the end of Caruso also excited James. Two people came to a passionate chest bump celebration. But Caruso really underestimated James’s strength and physical confrontation. After all, Yao Ming once said that James was basically as powerful as a pickup truck.<br>Although James didn’t hit Caruso, he chose to hit his chest. But Caruso was almost knocked out. Caruso spoke up yesterday when he talked about hitting James on the chest. James should be careful because he doesn’t know how powerful he is.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Caruso, I shouldn't have hit you! James made a public apology after the game/49a1dbcdad994d89b1ecfc970d5f7a53.jpg" alt="Caruso, I shouldn&#39;t have hit you! James made a public apology after the game"><br>Caruso said with a smile that James had an impact on him yesterday. He had 60-80 pounds of strength and was very strong. He was in pain. But Caruso also said that he didn’t blame James, because he was already excited at that time, James was also excited, the two can’t help but do it. Of course, Caruso is also witty. When James rushed up, he didn’t hit James head-on, but chose to sidestep a little.<br>Caruso also concedes the fact that he could be on the injury list if he didn’t avoid it. Today James officially apologized to Caruso, hoping to forgive his excitement.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Caruso, I shouldn't have hit you! James made a public apology after the game/e1cf446b3e0b46a09eb3b78030b88e41.jpg" alt="Caruso, I shouldn&#39;t have hit you! James made a public apology after the game"><br>In today’s updated instagram story, James posted a photo of himself interacting with Caruso. And wrote: “brother * *, yesterday was my fault! You made me so excited * * “<br>Yes, James also admitted that it was Caruso who made him so excited that he didn’t try hard. Instead, he chose to attack him with all his strength. Some netizens are also outspoken, James’ abandoned teammate ‘finally stone hammer. Because Caruso was almost hit by him into the injury list, the bully was born.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Caruso, I shouldn't have hit you! James made a public apology after the game/63397d549d954b81be840f6835d50b16.jpg" alt="Caruso, I shouldn&#39;t have hit you! James made a public apology after the game"><br>In addition, James’s performance also made his good brother Wade very excited. Many people said that James was no longer good. Wade is especially pushing James on social media today. Wade said straight who said James was angry? If James averaged 27 + 8 + 8 last season, then 99% of the players can’t play his data now, what are they?<br>As Caruso said today, the presence of James has a bottom in their hearts. Moreover, James, 34 and about to be 35, can still get 26.1 points, 8.3 rebounds, 11.1 assists and 1.57 steals.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Caruso, I shouldn't have hit you! James made a public apology after the game/5a0d7e09dd16404c9d866293044e3d7e.jpg" alt="Caruso, I shouldn&#39;t have hit you! James made a public apology after the game"><br>James is a point guard in the new season and often has to face a small guard, but his movement has improved compared with last season, and the assists have started to soar, which is a good phenomenon for the Lakers. When Rondo returns, Davis and Howard will be more destructive.</p>

At the last moment, the Spurs were only 2 points short, but the Wizards seized the chance to free throw. The Spurs suffered a humiliating seven straight loss! The Knicks lost 104-109 to 76 people. Morris and embid almost started in the third quarter, but embid restrained. The Knicks had hoped to have a cold away game, but Scott scored two or three points in a row at the last moment, killing the suspense of the game.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Crazy West!

The Clippers Nuggets help the Lakers, the top four come out, three teams close to the Warriors"><br>Lone ranger 142-94 beat warriors, NBA massacre, dongqiqi got 25 points in the first quarter, more than the whole warrior team, half-time spent, if it’s not Jordan Poole’s last attack opportunity persistent layup, it’s 50 points! Warriors lost 48 points also created the team’s biggest losing point difference since 1973. Heaven has reincarnation. Who can heaven bypass? Green dodged, his right foot was sore, an excuse only in the Spurs!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Crazy West!

The heat beat the Cavaliers 124-100, and the bulls 109-89 beat the pistons. Today rose got 18 points, plus or minus 5, while the main players, including Griffin and Johnson, are basically under - 30! Ross tried his best. He couldn’t take the piston. After five consecutive defeats, the piston has caught up with the Knicks!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Crazy West!

The Clippers Nuggets help the Lakers, the top four come out, three teams close to the Warriors"><br>The Timberwolves lost 95-103 at home to the jazz. Two days ago, Wiggins was absent. The Timberwolves won away. Now Wiggins is back. He’s still at home. He’s lost! Wiggins got 22 points and 7 rebounds, 3 points and 10 in 1. TIG continued to dribble for 18 seconds. There was no way for Downes to fight with gobel! Nuggets 105-95 defeated a team in the west, ending eight consecutive wins, but also let themselves in the rankings against the opponent.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Crazy West!

The Clippers Nuggets help the Lakers, the top four come out, three teams close to the Warriors"><br>The most exciting thing is the first show of the combination of clippers and Celtics, the combination of cayenne pepper, the low performance of xiaoka and the average performance of pickled pepper, all of which have become the background plate. The limelight has been robbed by Beverly, the dog. The last two three points in the regular time, two three points in the extra time, and the foul on walker at the last time is also very smart. Old rivers, you can steal the joy. Beverly, luway and Harrell of your team Isn’t it the big three? Now it’s the big five!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Crazy West!

The Clippers Nuggets help the Lakers, the top four come out, three teams close to the Warriors"><br>In terms of the Western Conference Rankings, the Lakers continued to lead with a 12-2 record. Thanks to nuggets, the Lakers have opened up the distance with the teams behind them. It’s a 1.5 win. Thanks to the clippers, Celtic’s defeat also made the Lakers top the League! The Lakers play thunder in the next game. Thunder has a feud with Xiao Hua. The clipper Lakers take turns without rest.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Crazy West!

The Clippers Nuggets help the Lakers, the top four come out, three teams close to the Warriors"><br>The current top four in the west, ESPN’s pre-season forecast of the top four in the west, is only slightly changed, with clippers and Lakers in the top two and Denver fourth. But we can be sure that these four teams are the strongest team in the west at present. After a month’s fighting, the top four teams in the West are finally coming out. Of course, the lone Rangers behind are not to be underestimated, but the lone rangers are unstable. We need to know that they have lost to the Knicks twice. If they don’t lose, they are the second team in the West now!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Crazy West! The Clippers Nuggets help the Lakers, the top four come out, three teams close to the Warriors/1f45d676560548818501168ba0b9109b.jpg" alt="Crazy West! The Clippers Nuggets help the Lakers, the top four come out, three teams close to the Warriors"><br>The sun and the Timberwolves, the two biggest black horses in the west, are fading. The Timberwolves are trapped in the absence of Wiggins before, and the sun side has been blocked because of the back spasm of Rubio. They are not far behind the king, it can be predicted that the playoff ticket competition is still very fierce!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Crazy West! The Clippers Nuggets help the Lakers, the top four come out, three teams close to the Warriors/300f84b9d846474790743764ff4ec1d7.jpg" alt="Crazy West! The Clippers Nuggets help the Lakers, the top four come out, three teams close to the Warriors"><br>The gap between pelican, thunder and the front is not big, but from Grizzlies, it has changed a bit. Grizzlies lost twice in a row. Morant, the core of the team, has been very depressed recently, and they are gradually approaching warriors. At the same time, there are also pioneers coming to the warriors. They lost 8 of the last 10 games, went to the doctor in a hurry and signed Anthony. The effect is not so good. The other came to the warriors, the Spurs, losing 7 times in a row! This is definitely not the end of the Spurs’ losing streak. The Spurs will play 76ers and Knicks back-to-back on the road, and then go back to play the Lakers, Timberwolves and Clippers. How is Popovich? Can you hold on?<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Crazy West! The Clippers Nuggets help the Lakers, the top four come out, three teams close to the Warriors/ec6ba0b05ae0488ca879261c9e787b09.jpg" alt="Crazy West! The Clippers Nuggets help the Lakers, the top four come out, three teams close to the Warriors"><br>Warriors, as always, as stable as the defensive tower, I don’t know how many games they can win this season, and how many unlucky people can lose to them.</p>

    <title>Combination of pepper into the background plate! Old rivers, you can steal the music. Now the team has five giants</title>
    <url>/2019/11/23/Combination%20of%20pepper%20into%20the%20background%20plate!%20Old%20rivers,%20you%20can%20steal%20the%20music.%20Now%20the%20team%20has%20five%20giants/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Combination of pepper into the background plate! Old rivers, you can steal the music. Now the team has five giants/b18e4c82170a4b8480e36b65ee62a516.jpg" alt="Combination of pepper into the background plate! Old rivers, you can steal the music. Now the team has five giants"><br>In an NBA regular season game that ended at noon on November 21, the Clippers 107-104 Celtics at home fought hard until extra time. In the words of Mr. Yang Yi, it was really a confrontation at the level of the finals! After a long month of waiting, pickled peppers came back, Leonard’s injury suspension came back, but the game was very unexpected, to some extent, it can be said that this is a failure of the first show! Of course, the clippers have a deep family background. Even if the brothers are in a downturn, they can win the victory without any danger. Maybe the fans of other teams are uncomfortable.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Combination of pepper into the background plate! Old rivers, you can steal the music. Now the team has five giants/560a5fa6dfb64a3fa18d8b74972b8229.jpg" alt="Combination of pepper into the background plate! Old rivers, you can steal the music. Now the team has five giants"><br>Let’s talk about Leonard first. Leonard played 38 minutes, 7 in 20, 3 in 10, got 17 points, 6 rebounds, 3 assists, 3 steals and 5 mistakes! Today, whether it’s smart or Tatum, the restriction on Leonard is really in place. Only Celtic dare to defend like this. As long as Leonard takes the ball for action, he has to attack. Celtic prefer not to play inside, and they have to protect their frontline defense strength, which also forces Leonard to make continuous mistakes! The Celtic defense really pushed Leonard to the edge. In the fourth quarter, he was robbed by Jay brown, who was the big cap twice. But the embarrassment was that when Leonard was off the court, the clipper only used a wave of 8-0 to wipe out the difference! At the end of extra time, Leonard first missed a man by Tatum, then was robbed by smart. Two words: low!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Combination of pepper into the background plate! Old rivers, you can steal the music. Now the team has five giants/d93cb99d1e47497d8742e6886971643f.jpg" alt="Combination of pepper into the background plate! Old rivers, you can steal the music. Now the team has five giants"><br>Talk about pickled peppers. Paojiao played 37 minutes today, 8 of 18, with 25 points, 8 assists and 5 rebounds. Although the data is good, he may not be as effective as he thought. When Leonard and he were on the court today, one handled the ball on the strong side, the other waited for the chance on the weak side, while pickled peppers were often the one waiting for the chance on the weak side. In Mr. Yang Yi’s words, Leonard and pickled peppers went out together, both sides were very concerned about rationality, trying to complete the attack in the most appropriate way, but many times, in the face of the Celtic attack, either pickled peppers or Leonard’s fault! And Paojiao was also shaken by Tatum at the end of the regular time. The contribution of Paojiao in the whole fourth quarter may only be the three-point extra time, which was fed by Beverly after he grabbed the rebounds in the front court.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Combination of pepper into the background plate! Old rivers, you can steal the music. Now the team has five giants/f1ac0e9afb454f738552cc672d1a6a03.jpg" alt="Combination of pepper into the background plate! Old rivers, you can steal the music. Now the team has five giants"><br>Said so many actually with a few words summary card pepper today’s performance: aggression is not enough!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Combination of pepper into the background plate! Old rivers, you can steal the music. Now the team has five giants/8e4bcb0a91314424a87b03d477fc0a43.jpg" alt="Combination of pepper into the background plate! Old rivers, you can steal the music. Now the team has five giants"><br>Finally, let’s talk about Beverly. In fact, Beverly is in the fast ship today. His right to sell is supposed to be after Paojiao, xiaoka, Luwei and Harrell, but he did a good job at both ends of attack and defense today! 41 minutes, 11 in 5, 3 in 7 in 4, a total of 14 points, 16 rebounds, 7 assists, 3 steals, 2 blocks, absolutely the MVP of the game!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Combination of pepper into the background plate! Old rivers, you can steal the music. Now the team has five giants/79629b5a07674a96983bda8327046626.jpg" alt="Combination of pepper into the background plate! Old rivers, you can steal the music. Now the team has five giants"><br>The 8-0 attack wave in the last four minutes of the clipper was driven by Beverly’s three points. When Celtic almost locked the victory in the last minute, Beverly scored another three points, leading the team to another wave of 8-0 climax, directly surpassing the score! If it wasn’t for Tatum to hit three points after shaking the pickled peppers, the Clippers would have won the game in the regular time!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Combination of pepper into the background plate! Old rivers, you can steal the music. Now the team has five giants/e5dba94076e242289ccff10d7ac0df1f.jpg" alt="Combination of pepper into the background plate! Old rivers, you can steal the music. Now the team has five giants"><br>Beverly is really excited. In the last few rounds of the defensive end, he stares at Walker, including the foul in the last three seconds, to help the team win directly. We need to know that Beverly’s annual salary is only 12.35 million dollars. Although he is not tall, he is a perfect Attack Defense 3D!<br>Old rivers must have never thought that neither of them gave up their own domineering spirit in the first battle of cachomie. If there is no Luwei, the clipper can’t make it to the end. If there is no Beverly, the clipper can’t win the Celtic!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Combination of pepper into the background plate! Old rivers, you can steal the music. Now the team has five giants/94516a9173944b3e8d9c05d034ec9bef.jpg" alt="Combination of pepper into the background plate! Old rivers, you can steal the music. Now the team has five giants"><br>This is the terrible part of the clipper. The three brothers, Luwei, Beverly and Harrell, have built the frame of the house for kadjin. Kadjin only needs to fill in things. Unfortunately, they failed in the first game.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Los Angeles Lakers beat the heat in a row of seven. I have to say that the Lakers are really good in the new season, and LeBron James is still back in shape. Recently he talked about Leonard’s “load management” of the clipper. James on the open showdown, a reporter asked the Lakers next week will usher in the back-to-back game. And ask James if he’s going to rotate like Leonard?<br>James gave a reply: “if I get hurt, I won’t play. If I don’t get hurt, I’ll play. That’s what I’ve always believed. “<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Didn't start Howard talked about McGee's showdown, and James offered a privilege/583b79e90325414d9f5ded3870ae156b.jpg" alt="Didn&#39;t start Howard talked about McGee&#39;s showdown, and James offered a privilege"><br>It seems that the Lakers players should be very healthy this season, because the personnel rotation of Vogel is reasonable. The only drawback is that James’s playing time has been too long in the past few games, but James’s physical fitness can still stand up to it, and he doesn’t need to take turns.<br>In addition, the Lakers atmosphere is also good, in the past few games, Howard’s performance is obviously better than McGee. Many fans also question why Vogel did not let Howard start, which is not very fair for Howard. But Warcraft didn’t seem to care if he could start, and Howard kept yelling at McGee yesterday to encourage him.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Didn't start Howard talked about McGee's showdown, and James offered a privilege/6f2b914e715a4628b0095a5f6b2de129.jpg" alt="Didn&#39;t start Howard talked about McGee&#39;s showdown, and James offered a privilege"><br>Today, Howard once again showed his affection to McGrady on social media. It seems that he didn’t really want to compete with McGrady for the start. “I’m proud of you, McGee,” Howard wrote on social media. Keep growing, brother! Karim Abdul Mackey, you did a great job, brother. I’m glad to witness your growth. God bless you. This is our season! * *<br>Howard admired McKee very much and always regarded him as the contemporary Tiangou (Karim Abdul Jabbar), so he called him “Karim Abdul McKee”.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Didn't start Howard talked about McGee's showdown, and James offered a privilege/195648cc738c400c9c92a16d4e897ae7.jpg" alt="Didn&#39;t start Howard talked about McGee&#39;s showdown, and James offered a privilege"><br>In fact, Vogel also has his own plan. There are two possibilities for Howard to make a substitute. First: it’s to protect his health. After all, playing substitute is better than starting. Second: to strengthen the firepower of the second team, Howard is very efficient as a substitute. In the past six games, he has scored 42 points in 21 out of 24 shots and hit more than 90%.<br>It’s obvious that Vogel’s use of Howard is more like the use of Harrell for clippers, as the second lineup’s basket guard. It also makes Howard more comfortable to play. While reducing injuries, let him and Davis and James seamless connection, everyone is relaxed. say<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Didn't start Howard talked about McGee's showdown, and James offered a privilege/ee3ca33b7b3241e480c23ce8b55dc7c7.jpg" alt="Didn&#39;t start Howard talked about McGee&#39;s showdown, and James offered a privilege"><br>To put it bluntly, McGrady’s starting game is like a meat shield arranged by Vogel for Howard to fight against a wave of injuries first and then let Howard play. And Howard also has a privilege in the second team, which is to have a lot of shooting power. There’s more presence in positioning than starting, as James said.<br>When he cooperates with the second team, he likes to cooperate with Howard’s pick and roll very much, which is tantamount to James giving Howard a privilege to form a set of combo boxing with himself. Vogel has worked hard.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Didn't start Howard talked about McGee's showdown, and James offered a privilege/4551ec910738482db53fa694f37d8c4d.jpg" alt="Didn&#39;t start Howard talked about McGee&#39;s showdown, and James offered a privilege"><br>In addition, when it comes to James’ new season positioning compared with last season, Vogel showdown. He believes that the new season allows James to use the ball to maximize the use of value, rather than as Walton let him when no player.<br>“It’s the right choice for LeBron to control the ball and let him decide for himself when to be decisive and when to pass to his teammates,” Vogel said. He’s reading defense, and he’s willing to work hard on the defense side, he’s willing to pass the ball on the offense side, and obviously LeBron can hit the key ball at the critical moment</p>

It was the first time for lone ranger to face a Spurs with a winning rate of less than 50% in 11 years. Before the game, lone ranger coach Carlisle also took the initiative to help Popovich relieve pressure: the Spurs did a good job in training new players, but this is not a one-day event.

In fact, Popovich has not criticized drozan since the previous five consecutive defeats, and even took the initiative to protect the players in front of the media, saying that they played very well, but to be honest, all the fans are aware of the problem, the Spurs is not like the Spurs.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Disgrace six times in a row!

The Spurs’ four defenders have only four assists in total, which is far from enough for a team that is good at conducting ball. In addition, the Spurs have nine assists less than their opponents and nine three-point goals less than their opponents. Although drozan broke out and scored 36 points, it is difficult for the Spurs to win the game in this way. Unless drozan can kill the game on his own like Hadden or Durant or James, but he’s not!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Disgrace six times in a row!

    <title>Dream green to win Cole finally admitted a fact when he talked about the difference between thunder and Warriors</title>
    <url>/2019/11/10/Dream%20green%20to%20win%20Cole%20finally%20admitted%20a%20fact%20when%20he%20talked%20about%20the%20difference%20between%20thunder%20and%20Warriors/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Golden State Warriors lost again. They lost to thunder 108-114 away today. Compared with the first Massacre by thunder, the warriors made progress in this 6-point loss. For the warriors fans, the new season is not in their mind. In the past, Warriors used to play? It’s a big win to wake up. Now the warriors don’t have to watch the game, wake up is a big defeat. I can also easily sleep again.<br>Who is the most bitter warrior now? It must be Cole and Russell. Curry and Thompson are the most depressed. Green is very good.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Dream green to win Cole finally admitted a fact when he talked about the difference between thunder and Warriors/004df879c3254f4095aca55beabb487c.jpg" alt="Dream green to win Cole finally admitted a fact when he talked about the difference between thunder and Warriors"><br>This season everyone is looking forward to green fulfilling his talent, especially after Curie’s injury. We all focus on green, just want to see how fierce he has unlimited shooting power. What about the result? Green is also witty. His ligaments were torn just after his fingers were ready. It’s a big winner to get out and leave Russell with his work and fame.<br>Before you [Durant] came, we won the championship. Now before you Russell got hurt, I got hurt. Green again uses Green’s formula like fire. Of course, it’s not a fake injury. Green is really injured. This is the lucky body.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Dream green to win Cole finally admitted a fact when he talked about the difference between thunder and Warriors/6dceb7b2f50f484a82dd4c0a3dd6e690.jpg" alt="Dream green to win Cole finally admitted a fact when he talked about the difference between thunder and Warriors"><br>Now Russell is funny. He’s going to be the fourth in the warriors this summer. I didn’t expect that these three eldest brothers were cruel enough, and finally they helped him to become eldest brother to resist pressure. It turns out that it’s really boring to be the warrior boss. Look at the past few comments on Russell? What empty cut group leader, inefficient scorer, is not the foundation stone of team building, cancer. Russell’s negative emotions directly + 9999.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Dream green to win Cole finally admitted a fact when he talked about the difference between thunder and Warriors/df8d74c266aa419c92d42bf8a1d5f768.jpg" alt="Dream green to win Cole finally admitted a fact when he talked about the difference between thunder and Warriors"><br>Russell played 34 minutes today, 19 for 10, 30 points, 3 rebounds, 7 assists, 2 steals. In an interview after the game, Russell was dead in the face. The tears in his eyes could not be covered by his glasses.<br>Russell was desperate when he talked about warriors, and there was nothing to say. It’s mainly about injuries. Finally, I’d like to make a tough speech. What warrior will be back on track, losing is distracting but needs to focus, will be OK and so on some chicken soup Wen. Don’t say the fans don’t believe it, even Russell said these words are false.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Dream green to win Cole finally admitted a fact when he talked about the difference between thunder and Warriors/4808bfb02fc9439b8d2f00253141a6b3.jpg" alt="Dream green to win Cole finally admitted a fact when he talked about the difference between thunder and Warriors"><br>Finally, let’s talk about Cole. Three years ago, the warriors had the best record in NBA history, 73-9. This year, with the warriors’ three melons and two dates, Cole is going to have a 73-9 win. Don’t think it’s impossible.<br>So what did Cole say after the game today? There are two aspects. The first one is: Cole recalled that three years ago, the warriors and thunder met in the Western Conference finals. Now the two teams are facing the same situation, playing badly or hitting the playoffs? Second: Cole wants to have both fish and bear paws, that is to say, warriors can put on rotten, but it’s better not to lose too much, or he will have no light on his face.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Dream green to win Cole finally admitted a fact when he talked about the difference between thunder and Warriors/2fffd80de7094131943e967de12fddb2.jpg" alt="Dream green to win Cole finally admitted a fact when he talked about the difference between thunder and Warriors"><br>Cole said: “the warriors and thunder have met in the past three years. At that time, we were all elite teams, but now we are in a position and have entered a new stage. Thunder has clearly understood what its next stage is like, and we have not yet understood what our next stage will be. We shouldn’t be willing to accept fate, saying that we’ve had injuries, we’re playing with two-way contract players, in order to get the lottery and so on. No, we should win more games * * “<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Dream green to win Cole finally admitted a fact when he talked about the difference between thunder and Warriors/7f271f3341984e6fba4a2a76c786b18e.jpg" alt="Dream green to win Cole finally admitted a fact when he talked about the difference between thunder and Warriors"><br>Cole’s point is obvious. He doesn’t really understand whether the warriors want to play bad or continue to play in the playoffs? So he borrowed thunder to show off the warriors, hoping to let them know. But he still hopes to keep his record and get high ranking rookies at the same time, which is a fact in front of him.<br>In terms of external speculation, it’s certainly more cost-effective for a warrior to put on a bad show. Russell can give him this year to brush the data, next year with his trade in exchange for a starting front. At that time, it will be 1 Curie + 2 Thompson + 3 new frontline + 4 green + 5 Rooney starting five tigers, plus a high ranking team building cornerstone, not Meizizi?</p>

    <title>Eight winning streak! Hadenway doesn&#39;t want to storm the pioneers with 64 points. Anthony narrowly escaped</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>A regular season NBA game ended on the morning of November 19. The Blazers were away from home. The Blazers were in a terrible state recently, 132-108. The Blazers lost another game today! In the early days, the US media released Anthony’s training video for the low post singles training. He was in good condition and basically free. Including mclem, he also said that Anthony was ready to play, but he still didn’t play today. He is expected to play as early as tomorrow when he plays the pelican back-to-back. Anthony has survived, but the Blazers are losing again today!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Eight winning streak! Hadenway doesn't want to storm the pioneers with 64 points. Anthony narrowly escaped/9a2146b548ec449e995cea3e8a0c8ea6.jpg" alt="Eight winning streak! Hadenway doesn&#39;t want to storm the pioneers with 64 points. Anthony narrowly escaped"><br>In terms of data, little’s 11 points and 7 rebounds, white edge’s 11 points and 8 rebounds, mclem’s 25 points and 5 rebounds, and Lillard’s 4 out of 15 only got 13 points and 11 assists. In addition, Simons, besmore and rabisier also scored double. Opposite data, house 11 points 6 rebounds, Tucker 13 points, Capella 22 points 20 rebounds, Haden 36 points 6 rebounds 5 assists, Wes 28 points 13 rebounds 10 assists.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Eight winning streak! Hadenway doesn't want to storm the pioneers with 64 points. Anthony narrowly escaped/faa320479fa84056b921057ca199f1d4.jpg" alt="Eight winning streak! Hadenway doesn&#39;t want to storm the pioneers with 64 points. Anthony narrowly escaped"><br>In the first quarter, the Blazers were able to hold the score tightly. On the first day, mcclemy led the team 5-0 in the lead, and then they were stunned. House, Tucker and harden scored three points in a row, weishao also scored, and the Blazers were widened. Fortunately, Lillard came out in time, and the substitutes attacked the interior line in turn. The Blazers in a single quarter were 1 point ahead. In the second quarter, Wei Shao led the backup team to break out. First, he got 3 points, and then he assisted little rivers to hit 3 points. When the Blazers stopped bleeding, harden scored 2-3 points in a row. At the end of the quarter, Wei Shao and harden had another wave of climax. At the end of the half, the Blazers were 14 points behind.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Eight winning streak! Hadenway doesn't want to storm the pioneers with 64 points. Anthony narrowly escaped/50c8115397fe4c58866c3e62007f472c.jpg" alt="Eight winning streak! Hadenway doesn&#39;t want to storm the pioneers with 64 points. Anthony narrowly escaped"><br>When the third quarter came back, house’s three points also opened, plus Capella’s taking whatever he wants under the basket, the Blazers once fell behind by as much as 20 points, but the Blazers were good at opening their hands at the offensive end, but the defensive end was still unable to withstand the double attack mode of harden and weishao, the third quarter ended, 99-76! At the beginning of the fourth quarter, Blazer manager stoz also suffered a technical foul. Wesa led a wave of 7-0 in the middle to completely kill the suspense of the game, and finally Blazer lost to the opponent on the road!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Eight winning streak! Hadenway doesn't want to storm the pioneers with 64 points. Anthony narrowly escaped/86a416b91a964944b75e5ed9fe95c5fd.jpg" alt="Eight winning streak! Hadenway doesn&#39;t want to storm the pioneers with 64 points. Anthony narrowly escaped"><br>Hardon and Wes had 64 points, 19 rebounds and 15 assists in this game, which seems to be very explosive, but you know, it just exceeded their season average! In the list of the strongest two player group in the League given by the US media, Hardon and weishao both scored 60.5 points in the league, while the second one was the Don’s Wiggins group, with only 52.7 points, Jamey’s group ranked fourth, and the two combined with only 49.5 points.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Eight winning streak!

Hadenway doesn&#39;t want to storm the pioneers with 64 points. Anthony narrowly escaped"><br>On the other hand, the Blazers, who have lost 7 in 9 games since November, have now fallen to the 13th place in the west, only leading the warriors by 3 games. In the future, they will have an away trip: Pelicans, bucks, knights and bulls. Can Anthony help the team?<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Eight winning streak! Hadenway doesn't want to storm the pioneers with 64 points. Anthony narrowly escaped/60e7a06a4b204369bfc1747b71ea1fd7.jpg" alt="Eight winning streak! Hadenway doesn&#39;t want to storm the pioneers with 64 points. Anthony narrowly escaped"><br>Since the back-to-back defeat of Grizzlies, Hardon has won eight consecutive games, including warriors, bulls, pelicans, clippers, walkers, Timberwolves and explorers. At present, the team closely follows the Lakers with 11-3 record, only 0.5 games behind the Lakers. But then the schedule is not optimistic, against nuggets and lone Rangers in a row, to see how long they can keep the second place in the West.</p>

    <title>Fifty thousand dollars for freedom of speech Leonard mentioned Shaw&#39;s showdown after the game, and the team doctor explained</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Los Angeles Clippers beat the Blazers 107-101 at home today, giving them three straight defeats. Leonard, the leader of the clippers, finally came back. In the last game with the Bucks, Leonard took a back-to-back rotation. Today Leonard is still in good shape. In the first three quarters, he didn’t feel good, only got 9 points, but in the last quarter, Leonard scored 18 points. And made 10 free throws and hit 9. At the end of the day, the Blazers couldn’t stop Leonard at all, only fouls. Lillard and McCollam lost to Leonard, and of course, Lowe scored five points in the final minute.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Fifty thousand dollars for freedom of speech Leonard mentioned Shaw's showdown after the game, and the team doctor explained/f67272ca98e04cdc9512a79d180c5248.jpg" alt="Fifty thousand dollars for freedom of speech Leonard mentioned Shaw&#39;s showdown after the game, and the team doctor explained"><br>Leonard thought it was a good feeling for his comeback from his rotation, but he was a little rusty because of his poor hand. But on the defensive end, Leonard said the Clippers did a good job today, and they finally killed the Blazers by defense. Leonard also talked about the fact that he had fined the clipper $50000 for his rotation.<br>Leonard is very dissatisfied with the league’s handling of this matter. Leonard thinks Xiao Hua is really cold-blooded and ruthless. Because I chose to take a rotation because I was really hurt. And the league is fined for that, which will chill the players.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Fifty thousand dollars for freedom of speech Leonard mentioned Shaw's showdown after the game, and the team doctor explained/9551f12fc22f4df0bd71f7bf8b3f4152.jpg" alt="Fifty thousand dollars for freedom of speech Leonard mentioned Shaw&#39;s showdown after the game, and the team doctor explained"><br>Leonard said: “I feel good coming back today. We held on to the end and won the game with tenacity. In addition, I am surprised that the team has been fined by the League for their comments about my health. To be honest, I can’t understand the behavior of the alliance. Because it surprised and disappointed me a little. I feel that the League [Xiao Hua] is hurting players. They want them to play when they are not ready. But I’m not going to listen. I’m going to do something to keep myself healthy before I can help the team succeed<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Fifty thousand dollars for freedom of speech Leonard mentioned Shaw's showdown after the game, and the team doctor explained/a6b8233469734df9ae8fff45fb34f4ca.jpg" alt="Fifty thousand dollars for freedom of speech Leonard mentioned Shaw&#39;s showdown after the game, and the team doctor explained"><br>The reason for this is that the Clippers took a rotation of Leonard, but old rivers didn’t say that Leonard was suspended because of his injuries, because Leonard didn’t want to let others know about his injuries, he defined these as his privacy does not want to go public. Old rivers can only say that he is very healthy, so the NBA thinks that clipper is deliberately taking turns to rest players from the comments made by clipper team. It is clear that he is healthy but not allowed to play and let the fans down. After all, Leonard and alphanumeric are very interesting.<br>A lot of fans paid a lot of money to buy tickets, but Leonard was not the main character, and the League certainly lost money. So the League warned the Clippers by fined them $50000 for their inconsistent comments.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Fifty thousand dollars for freedom of speech Leonard mentioned Shaw's showdown after the game, and the team doctor explained/24fe205d86cc41f3bdb54368244dc758.jpg" alt="Fifty thousand dollars for freedom of speech Leonard mentioned Shaw&#39;s showdown after the game, and the team doctor explained"><br>In other words, the clippers were punished because they didn’t have the same caliber. But it seems to conflict with Xiao Hua’s freedom of speech. Because Xiao Hua advocates freedom of speech, what’s the fault of old rivers’ speech to Leonard’s health, which is also free speech in theory?<br>In addition, old rivers was also Frank before today’s game, he is afraid to answer now. Because he was respecting Leonard’s privacy issues, the alliance finally let them down. Old rivers also satirized the League: “should the Clippers strike a balance between giving NBA transparency and respecting the privacy of small cards? I’m sorry that I” dare not answer “because I like to be fined *”<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Fifty thousand dollars for freedom of speech Leonard mentioned Shaw's showdown after the game, and the team doctor explained/e25198a1c7fb4dcda55130aad169705e.jpg" alt="Fifty thousand dollars for freedom of speech Leonard mentioned Shaw&#39;s showdown after the game, and the team doctor explained"><br>Old rivers turned and left, very dissatisfied. In addition, Leonard also revealed in an interview after the game that the team doctor can testify to himself: “doctor * * didn’t allow me to play back-to-back game * *”<br>Leonard’s point was clear. He was injured, and the doctors didn’t allow him to fight. And in terms of injuries, Leonard clearly means that the League shouldn’t infringe on his privacy. He has this right.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>On the morning of November 18, in an NBA regular season game, King met Celtic at home. Celtic was the hottest team in the league in recent years, and they scored 10 consecutive wins. And King’s schedule is also very difficult. Just after the last game away from the Lakers, he will go back to the home court to face Celtic and Suns. Of course, in November, king gives people a feeling that he has a bright future. 100-99, King narrowly beat Celtic in the home court by one point, ending his opponent’s ten consecutive wins. At the same time, he also keeps himself away from warriors and pelicans in the ranking, and advances to the top eight in the West!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Free throw! Out of the way, Celtic's ten straight wins are over, and another team in the west is emerging/eeea2e37e435463ab5eef5b75d020940.jpg" alt="Free throw! Out of the way, Celtic&#39;s ten straight wins are over, and another team in the west is emerging"><br>In terms of data, for Celtic, brown scored 18 points and 8 rebounds, Tatum 14 points, Tess 14 points and 10 rebounds, Walker 15 points and 9 assists. In addition, ojele and Cantor scored double. On the king’s side, hild scored 35 points, Barnes scored 13 points, belica scored 12 points, and Bogdanovic scored 12 points and 10 assists.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Free throw!

Out of the way, Celtic&#39;s ten straight wins are over, and another team in the west is emerging"><br>In the first half, the king firmly took the initiative, and berecha and Holmes continued to play power, while Celtic attack was still slow and hot. Relying on the three points of dedmond and berecha in the middle of the first quarter, the king hit a wave of 12-1 climax, with the first quarter King 12 points ahead of Celtic. In the second quarter, the king’s attack slowed down, only 6 points in the first 6 minutes, while the Celtic’s ojele broke out, leading the team to make a 9-0 equalizing difference, and at the end of half-time, the king was only 4 points ahead of his opponent. Into the third quarter, Walker began to break through, and Brown’s three points after the success of equalizing the difference, the two sides into a stalemate. The end of the king’s outside line feel in time to recover, but Celtic in brown and Cantor led by a wave of small climax, the end of the three quarters Celtic led by four points.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Free throw!

Out of the way, Celtic&#39;s ten straight wins are over, and another team in the west is emerging"><br>In the last quarter, Bogdan’s three points helped the team to level the difference, but Tatum and warnemek regained the lead for the green army, hild led the team to a small climax, and Tatum got eight points in response! The kings didn’t give up, relying on Bogdan and Hilde to score three points again to surpass the score, while in the final stage, smart made a foul while grabbing the rebounds, Holmes made two free throws to lock in the winning game, smart’s self saving shot also failed to enter, 100-99!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Free throw! Out of the way, Celtic's ten straight wins are over, and another team in the west is emerging/669c1b09446545f8875d60fa8d6541cc.jpg" alt="Free throw! Out of the way, Celtic&#39;s ten straight wins are over, and another team in the west is emerging"><br>For Kenny Dalglish, the start of the season is a series of five consecutive defeats, which directly leads to the team’s lack of morale. In addition to the injury stoppage of fox, Bagley and others, they once fell to the bottom of the West. However, the general manager of the team Divac gave Walton full trust. In November, King won 5-2, including defeating jazz, blazers, eagles, Celtics and other teams. In the two lost games, one lost 4 points to raptors and the other lost 2 points to Lakers. The final referee report also showed that king was wrongly judged! At the end of the game, King surpassed spurs, blazers, thunder and Grizzlies 5-7, tied for ninth place in the West.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Free throw! Out of the way, Celtic's ten straight wins are over, and another team in the west is emerging/fc13dc5f83b745a2b319bba06c7df617.jpg" alt="Free throw! Out of the way, Celtic&#39;s ten straight wins are over, and another team in the west is emerging"><br>For Celtic, they are really in a hot state this season. After a disastrous start to 76, they are followed by a wave of unreasonable 10 consecutive wins. But to be honest, it is not necessarily a good thing that they are in a state too early. Moreover, the journey away from home is really difficult. Tomorrow they will play back-to-back sun, and there are clippers and nuggets waiting for them. In fact, as long as the Eastern team starts a continuous road trip in the west, it’s difficult. You’re like a 76er. You’re directly thrown away after 5-7 defeats. Raptors also lose the clippers and the lone Rangers in the road trip. It’s not surprising that they’re tired and the opponent’s strength is balanced as a whole.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Gods fight! Downes 36 + 10, Bill 44 + 10! Big defeat of Wood Wolf proves that brother wolfberry has become the wolf king/e2da07cba1994df4b71b2fe1ca8e67ff.jpg" alt="Gods fight! Downes 36 + 10, Bill 44 + 10! Big defeat of Wood Wolf proves that brother wolfberry has become the wolf king"><br>On November 16, the Washington Wizards finished the game with Minnesota Timberwolves. The Wizards beat Timberwolves 137-116, beating Timberwolves by 26 points. The Wizards finally ended their three consecutive defeats, while the Timberwolves ended their two consecutive wins. This season’s wizards are the eastern fish belly, which has been wandering in the East. This season, Timberwolves have become the western Black horse has always been in the top eight in the West. It’s really not easy for strange talent to win away games in the cold Minnesota. In the first half, the two teams played hard to break up. After half-time playing, the Wizards led by 3 points, but in the third quarter, the Wizards opened 26-19 to 10 points. In the last quarter, the Timberwolves failed to fight back and finally suffered a big defeat at home.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Gods fight! Downes 36 + 10, Bill 44 + 10! Big defeat of Wood Wolf proves that brother wolfberry has become the wolf king/0578cc46ab79470ba55c3310853fa44b.jpg" alt="Gods fight! Downes 36 + 10, Bill 44 + 10! Big defeat of Wood Wolf proves that brother wolfberry has become the wolf king"><br>The only variable of the game is Andrew Wiggins. He was absent from the game because of his grandmother’s death. 19 sixth place rookie point guard Calvert played first. He really couldn’t compare with Wiggins at both ends of the attack and defense. He took 11 points, 3 rebounds and 3 assists in 30 minutes, 4 in 10, 2 in 3 and 5 in 10. He went to limit Bill’s teeth searching. Because of that In order to create a fairy fight, bill and Downes play each other. However, the final protagonist of the play is gowiggins, the medlar who didn’t show up.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Gods fight! Downes 36 + 10, Bill 44 + 10! Big defeat of Wood Wolf proves that brother wolfberry has become the wolf king/81cf4757cad9489b9a7527b7d701103a.jpg" alt="Gods fight! Downes 36 + 10, Bill 44 + 10! Big defeat of Wood Wolf proves that brother wolfberry has become the wolf king"><br>First of all, Bill’s game is so explosive. In the whole game, he scored 37 minutes, 15 in 22, 1 in 3:5, 1 in 3 free throws, 14 in 13, 44 points, 10 assists, 3 rebounds, 2 steals and 1 block. He won the game by 31 points. Because Calver was the main defender of the game, he beat Calver in strength and explosive force. He kept scoring under the basket. Even if he failed to get points, he could cause damage. The key is to pull away In the third quarter of the difference, Bill scored 11 minutes in a single quarter, 7 in 9, 1 in 3, 1 in 3, 16 points, 2 rebounds, 1 assists in blocking, 26 points for the whole team of wizards, 19 points for the whole team of Timberwolves, and bill alone scored 16 points. Bill’s score was too explosive. It’s worth mentioning that he also scored 44 points against green Kay in the last game, that is, 44 + in two consecutive games. Bill’s average score this season has reached 29.7 points, Become the top scorer in the league.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Gods fight! Downes 36 + 10, Bill 44 + 10!

Big defeat of Wood Wolf proves that brother wolfberry has become the wolf king"><br>Downes’s performance in this game is not as good as Bill’s, but it’s also very good. In the whole game, he took 36 points, 10 rebounds, 3 assists, 1 steals, with a hit rate of 72.2% and a three-point hit rate of 66.7%. In the second quarter, Downes was quite strong, with a 9-minute, 6-in-7, 2-in-3, and 19 points, 3 rebounds. This performance is enough to make the fans at the scene happy, but it’s a pity It was in the third and last quarter that Downes scored only 11 points, which failed to help the Timberwolves turn the tables. But at least Downes and bill had one rule at a time, Bill had three, Downes had two.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Gods fight! Downes 36 + 10, Bill 44 + 10! Big defeat of Wood Wolf proves that brother wolfberry has become the wolf king/f2b65ab53e064e4d9e595480e59dffbd.jpg" alt="Gods fight! Downes 36 + 10, Bill 44 + 10! Big defeat of Wood Wolf proves that brother wolfberry has become the wolf king"><br>This fairy fight is enough to see that the forest wolf’s hard strength really declines after lacking Wiggins. Without Wiggins, the forest wolf can’t even beat the Wizards at the bottom of the East. Defending bill has become a big problem. Bill’s hit rate is 68.2% and he’s down 44 + 10, which shows how unsuccessful his defense is. If there’s a physical talent of top Wiggins, biergan I didn’t dare to attack the basketball so wantonly. The 2.03m height + 2.18M arm exhibition of Wiggins made bill pay a heavy price. In addition to his contribution to the defensive end, Wiggins made more contribution to the offensive end. He has contacted 25 + in six games, including four 30 + games and one 40 +. If there is Wiggins in this game, even if he plays against the wizards, he may not lose.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Gods fight! Downes 36 + 10, Bill 44 + 10! Big defeat of Wood Wolf proves that brother wolfberry has become the wolf king/eb933b0be97345dd86092e66dbe8b213.jpg" alt="Gods fight! Downes 36 + 10, Bill 44 + 10! Big defeat of Wood Wolf proves that brother wolfberry has become the wolf king"><br>Before the game against Detroit and Spurs, Wiggins played 33 + 6 + 5, 30 + 8 + 7, and wolfberry, who put down the thermos cup, has become the top super giant in the league. This season, he has averaged 25.9 points, 5.1 rebounds, 3.6 assists, 0.73 steals 1.09 blocks, 47.8% hit, and 36.1% three-point hit. His defense is no longer a soft rib but an advantage. His explosive scoring power is almost unstoppable , that’s the real strength of goji. If goji is in this game, the Timberwolves should win three times in a row. Goji feels like the core of the Timberwolves’ eyes. Downes is here to help him.<br>Wen / Yan Xiaobai</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>At noon on November 16, in an NBA regular season game, the warriors faced Celtic at home. In the past five years, when the warriors faced other teams at home, the winning rate was 85.5%, 12.3 points net, 2-3 and 8.4 points net. The Celtic overall feel of this game is very common. The warriors really saw the first glimmer of dawn when they defeated the League at home. However, 100-105, the warriors lost again, and the warriors suffered five consecutive defeats! Celtic’s 10 straight wins!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Green Army wins 10 consecutive victories!

Warrior even defeated minister was found out, 11 points 11 boards, cole to start"><br>Compared with the past few games, the biggest change of warriors today is to let Robinson play point guard, take Jordan Poole down, and let Pascal be the team’s small forward. It’s said that Pascal, a small forward, can’t keep up with the pace. Brown, who can run and jump on the opposite side, has much better flexibility than him. But Cole has a very awkward problem here: really let Pascal play power forward, where is green?<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Green Army wins 10 consecutive victories!

The warriors then maintained a double-digit lead, 32-23 in a single quarter.

In the third quarter, the warriors are still lack of offensive firepower. Celtic rely on smart and brown to continue to draw the difference, while the warriors only have Robinson and Pascal in scoring. At the end of Brown’s quarter, the warriors hit three consecutive three-point goals. The warriors rely on the free throws of Spelman and Jordan Poole to keep the difference from being widened!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Green Army wins 10 consecutive victories!

After green came back, he has played three games so far, including the warriors lost to jazz, Lakers and Celtic. His opponent is very strong. After three games, green got 25 points, 19 rebounds and 13 assists. You can call yourself the leader of this team! Why does the fourth quarter rely on Berks, Robinson and Pascal? Is it enough to average 8.3 + 6.3 + 4.3?<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Green Army wins 10 consecutive victories! Warrior even defeated minister was found out, 11 points 11 boards, cole to start/ee9180f294ca4e5f81fbd0dbf89854b0.jpg" alt="Green Army wins 10 consecutive victories! Warrior even defeated minister was found out, 11 points 11 boards, cole to start"><br>It must not be enough! Not only the fans, but also the American media are questioning the existence value of green for this warrior. We need to know that Pascal, who is in the same position, has an average of 15.5 points + 4.3 rebounds this season, with a hit rate of 52%. What he lacks is only experience and the accumulation of the game! Why insist on starting green? Especially in the fourth quarter, when Russell couldn’t play, green followed a group of second round boys and turned around.<br>It’s not terrible to lose, it’s terrible to lose! Even if the warriors keep losing, it’s worth training young players like Pascal, Bowman, Poole and Berks, but now they don’t have both.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Green Army wins 10 consecutive victories! Warrior even defeated minister was found out, 11 points 11 boards, cole to start/a8b3d6fd20e141b2852488922f495169.jpg" alt="Green Army wins 10 consecutive victories! Warrior even defeated minister was found out, 11 points 11 boards, cole to start"><br>Cole can’t stand it! At least it’s a signal and a statement to bring Pascal to the starting line. Pascal needs to practice in the game. It’s really hard to know that a second round rookie can contribute 15.5 points when he enters the NBA. Even if this warrior focuses on the lottery, they also need to train new forces to wait for a new rise rather than continue to use players that will not help the team.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Green Army wins 10 consecutive victories!

    <title>Harder than the Lakers! 66 + 21, the big three are crazy! Warrior&#39;s 100 million giants cut two pairs in vain, and suffered bad news again</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>On November 16, the Lakers beat the kings 99-97 at home, winning three consecutive games since their last defeat to the Raptors. At present, they continue to rank first in the West with a record of 10-2 loss.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Harder than the Lakers! 66 + 21, the big three are crazy! Warrior's 100 million giants cut two pairs in vain, and suffered bad news again/0f6a2afa36634ca59ffd71da5627905e.jpg" alt="Harder than the Lakers! 66 + 21, the big three are crazy! Warrior&#39;s 100 million giants cut two pairs in vain, and suffered bad news again"><br>Celtic, on the court today, also won the warriors 105-100. At present, Celtic’s record is 10-1, and they keep winning 10 times in a row. Compared with the Lakers, the Celtics have a higher winning rate and record, and the Celtics have a much longer winning streak than the Lakers, and they are the first in the league. In the Celtic game against the warriors, the three giants Jason Tatum, Ken bawalker and Jay Brown broke out together again. Jason Tatum went out for 38 minutes, made 8 of 23 shots, 2 of 3-pointers, 2 of 7 free throws, 6 of 7 free throws, and got 24 points, 8 rebounds, 1 assists and 3 steals.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Harder than the Lakers! 66 + 21, the big three are crazy!

Warrior&#39;s 100 million giants cut two pairs in vain, and suffered bad news again"><br>Kenbavolk played 39 minutes, 6 of 19 shots, 3 of 12 three-point shots, 5 of 5 free throws, and got comprehensive data of 20 points, 5 rebounds, 5 assists, 1 steals and 1 block. Jerry Brown played 35 minutes, 9 for 17, 3 for 3, 1 for free throw, got 22 points, 8 rebounds, 3 assists and 3 steals. Jerron brown and Tatum beat the warriors forward group led by dramond green.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Harder than the Lakers! 66 + 21, the big three are crazy! Warrior's 100 million giants cut two pairs in vain, and suffered bad news again/8d1e22c3fb074fd9ab8ce3dc7f8b96ba.jpg" alt="Harder than the Lakers! 66 + 21, the big three are crazy! Warrior&#39;s 100 million giants cut two pairs in vain, and suffered bad news again"><br>Green army three giants, in today’s joint blow down 66 points, 21 rebounds, 9 assists, 7 steals, and a total of eight three-point shots. Green’s brown, Tatum and walker are Celtic’s top scorers on offense today. The three of them broke out together and made the Celtics laugh to the end. Tatum and Jerry Brown are very efficient on the offensive side. They are crazy.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Harder than the Lakers! 66 + 21, the big three are crazy! Warrior's 100 million giants cut two pairs in vain, and suffered bad news again/2eb9521fdc9f48bf8cc41bdda01ca278.jpg" alt="Harder than the Lakers! 66 + 21, the big three are crazy! Warrior&#39;s 100 million giants cut two pairs in vain, and suffered bad news again"><br>For the warriors, drammond green, a giant with four-year body and back of $100 million, played 34 minutes today, 3-for-6, 1-for-3, 4-for-4, and 4-for-5 free throws, getting two pairs of data of 11 points, 11 rebounds, 4 assists, 2 steals and 1 block. However, Drummond green cut two pairs in the air today, but was unable to lead the team to win. The warriors, who have lost six straight games, continue to be at the bottom of the league with a 2-11 record.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Harder than the Lakers! 66 + 21, the big three are crazy! Warrior's 100 million giants cut two pairs in vain, and suffered bad news again/277a461cc6c945e5a935936bff8c7afe.jpg" alt="Harder than the Lakers! 66 + 21, the big three are crazy! Warrior&#39;s 100 million giants cut two pairs in vain, and suffered bad news again"><br>What’s more, it’s important to note that the warriors’ Star Defender, Dan Gilo Russell, who has a four-year $117 million top salary contract, has also been injured. Russell left with a finger injury in the third quarter and has not returned since. According to warrior official news, Russell’s right thumb X-ray test results are negative, no structural damage. But Russell will have an MRI on Saturday local time. This means that Russell will miss many games due to injury. By November 23, the warriors will have four consecutive visitors, with pelicans, grizzlies, lone Rangers and jazz playing each other. These teams are all from the western division. In the last five seasons, these Western teams have been firmly suppressed by the warriors. Facing the wounded warriors, these four teams are bound to want revenge.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Harder than the Lakers! 66 + 21, the big three are crazy! Warrior's 100 million giants cut two pairs in vain, and suffered bad news again/cded26da7cf04a0e9a7ba2de990c15ed.jpg" alt="Harder than the Lakers! 66 + 21, the big three are crazy! Warrior&#39;s 100 million giants cut two pairs in vain, and suffered bad news again"><br>After Russell was injured, the warriors were led by only dramonde green. Drummond Green’s ability to lead the team will be severely tested. Perhaps, a new wave of 4 consecutive defeats is coming, and 10 consecutive defeats are already on the way? For Drummond green, his character’s lack of quality and scoring ability will be exposed. Moreover, he will encounter unprecedented public opinion doubts.<br>After clay Thompson, curry and Russell were injured, can dramonde green lead the team to win? I’m afraid Drummond green should regret forcing Durant away at this time.</p>

    <title>I don&#39;t pass without shooting! After Paul reprimanded muscara, he stormed 33 Shane</title>
    <url>/2019/11/10/I%20don&#39;t%20pass%20without%20shooting!%20After%20Paul%20reprimanded%20muscara,%20he%20stormed%2033%20Shane/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>The thunder won. They beat the warriors 114-108 at home today. The thunder’s record this season is 4-5, which is nearly 50%. And judging from these games, thunder’s condition began to improve. Today, in the face of the warriors who beat crazy in the third quarter, thunder won the last with tenacity. Warriors hit 41-24. It seems that the brave three crazy people are coming again. But thunder’s final win proved one thing. They didn’t want to put on a bad show. Thunder may want to learn the way of the rise of clippers.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/I don't pass without shooting! After Paul reprimanded muscara, he stormed 33 Shane/6305411e38dd4b14aa6a8ac5b0187d58.jpg" alt="I don&#39;t pass without shooting! After Paul reprimanded muscara, he stormed 33 Shane"><br>The Clippers saw off Chris Paul two years ago, then cleaned up Griffin and Jordan Jr. Trident era is over, but clippers have no choice. They’re still focused on the playoffs, and they’re using the draft rights they’ve got to trade superstars to do further rebuilding. Thunder also got a lot of first round draft rights when they traded Westbrook and Paul George. They didn’t have to put it on display.<br>Because there is a drawback of putting bad, that is, the team is easy to be bad and will never turn over. It’s like Nix’s been in bad shape for years. What’s the use? The Suns have been rotten for many years. This year, whether they can make it to the playoffs or not depends on their early results.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/I don't pass without shooting! After Paul reprimanded muscara, he stormed 33 Shane/1b4cdbe2b21e41baa1dc26872f92131f.jpg" alt="I don&#39;t pass without shooting! After Paul reprimanded muscara, he stormed 33 Shane"><br>So the goal of thunder is to cultivate Alexander as the cornerstone of the team, and then let Paul assist him. And the team’s competitiveness has been maintained, with thunder’s draft vision, 2-3 years can become a championship team.<br>And Paul has made his teammates better. After today’s game, Paul praised the team’s defense. Especially in the second half they resisted the warrior’s counterattack. Paul thinks what thunder lacks now is confidence in shooting. You have to get the ball moving, then you have to keep shooting, play rhythm and aggressiveness, so they’re unstoppable.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/I don't pass without shooting! After Paul reprimanded muscara, he stormed 33 Shane/09301e77eecc455190006e11392d5e4f.jpg" alt="I don&#39;t pass without shooting! After Paul reprimanded muscara, he stormed 33 Shane"><br>In this game, Paul played 31 minutes, 11 shots 5, 16 points 5 rebounds 9 assists 2 steals. It is worth mentioning that Paul also mentioned Mike muscara. In today’s game, Paul has been reprimanding muscara. He told muscara that if you don’t keep shooting three points, he won’t pass the ball again. After listening to this, muscara again plucked up his courage to shoot. Finally, today’s three-point shot, five shots and three shots. At one point, muscara made 19-1 three-point shots.<br>Today, muscara played for 16 minutes, 3 of 5 shots, with 9 points, 4 rebounds and 2 assists. Thanks for Paul’s encouragement.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/I don't pass without shooting! After Paul reprimanded muscara, he stormed 33 Shane/ba66ce86c34149b79583ba93e55c92ed.jpg" alt="I don&#39;t pass without shooting! After Paul reprimanded muscara, he stormed 33 Shane"><br>Paul said of muscara: “I told muscara in the game to keep shooting. I told him that my talent is to create opportunities for teammates to shoot in empty positions. Especially for pitchers, I can get you vacant seats. But if you don’t dare to shoot, I won’t pass it to you. Because if a pitcher doesn’t take a shot if he gets a space, his opponent will despise us. So all we have to do is keep shooting. “<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/I don't pass without shooting! After Paul reprimanded muscara, he stormed 33 Shane/c461a96a15914313b5a6e3f4f8038202.jpg" alt="I don&#39;t pass without shooting! After Paul reprimanded muscara, he stormed 33 Shane"><br>The reason Westbrook hasn’t been comfortable with thunder in the past few years is that there are too few outside shooters and they are hesitant. Now the pain of weishao is felt by Paul. The good thing is that the arrival of Alexander and Gallinari has improved the thunder’s sense of space, at least more than the team’s shooters when Wes was at the moment. Paul is the beneficiary. In addition, Adams’s score of eating cake under the basket has decreased recently. Paul still needs to feed Adams more bread.</p>

    <title>I refuse to take turns! The Lakers made a great decision to win James seven times in a row and announced their retirement time</title>
    <url>/2019/11/10/I%20refuse%20to%20take%20turns!%20The%20Lakers%20made%20a%20great%20decision%20to%20win%20James%20seven%20times%20in%20a%20row%20and%20announced%20their%20retirement%20time/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Los Angeles Lakers beat visiting heat 95-80 today to win seven straight games. Even though Wade can’t play brother basketball with James today. But Wade also grabbed the camera in the game and kept joking with James. In addition, the Lakers have broken a record. They haven’t won seven consecutive games in the opening stage in the past eight years. This is the first time in eight years.<br>The Lakers are 7-1 down at the top of the league, so it’s hard to say that this season the Lakers have high hopes of winning the championship. They are too resilient at both ends of the attack and defense. Davis + Green + Howard + Bradley are good defenders. They are not afraid of how many points they fall behind.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/I refuse to take turns! The Lakers made a great decision to win James seven times in a row and announced their retirement time/7a8204d60747495fb87fccf62a5a5bd8.jpg" alt="I refuse to take turns! The Lakers made a great decision to win James seven times in a row and announced their retirement time"><br>LeBron James compared with last season’s state, this season is simply not the same. His movement speed is greatly improved, and his physical fitness is better. James is about to be 35 at the age of 34. It’s difficult for a general to be 34. Because most of the players are starting to decline at this age. For example, James’s good brother Chris Paul. At the age of 33, Paul was still a superstar, while at 34, Paul had declined significantly and began to become a regular point guard.<br>Today, James played 35 minutes and got 25 points, 4 rebounds and 6 assists from 10 of 19 shots. Still keeping the career average of 27 + 7 + 7, assistant James also increased the average assists of this season by 11.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/I refuse to take turns! The Lakers made a great decision to win James seven times in a row and announced their retirement time/32cefe07598e4ace84a145ac6bb749c2.jpg" alt="I refuse to take turns! The Lakers made a great decision to win James seven times in a row and announced their retirement time"><br>Some fans think that the Lakers have such a good record now. Can we learn from the Clippers to take a rest? Because Leonard had a lot of regular season breaks last season, and the lower limit of the Raptors was very high, so he could win without Leonard. Clippers can also support Leonard’s rotation this season. In this way, clippers can enhance their playoff competitiveness while protecting Leonard.<br>But James obviously doesn’t want to learn from clippers to take turns. He doesn’t think he needs to take turns, especially when there is no injury. In the past, the clippers were fined 50000 dollars by the League because they did not have any injuries.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/I refuse to take turns! The Lakers made a great decision to win James seven times in a row and announced their retirement time/0df9ccaf8fc64f9fba90876837138317.jpg" alt="I refuse to take turns! The Lakers made a great decision to win James seven times in a row and announced their retirement time"><br>A reporter asked, do you have anything to say about Leonard’s load management? James shook his head, thinking he didn’t want to talk about Leonard. Because he is him, he is himself. But James also said that if he is injured, he will not play, and if he is not injured, then he will play.<br>James said: “what I can tell you now is that Leonard is Leonard and LeBron is LeBron. I only talk about myself, not others. As for load management, next Wednesday and Thursday we will challenge the sun and warriors back to back, I will be ready. But I won’t tell you if I’ll take a back-to-back rotation. You can talk to Vogel! “<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/I refuse to take turns! The Lakers made a great decision to win James seven times in a row and announced their retirement time/039d5cb7c2ed441dab586c4f46b614d9.jpg" alt="I refuse to take turns! The Lakers made a great decision to win James seven times in a row and announced their retirement time"><br>Then reporters continue to ask, James will back-to-back rotation? James gave an answer, and he used his own analogy when the Cavaliers played. When the Cavaliers played, Taylor asked James to take a back-to-back rotation, but James did not want to take a rotation, but wanted to play.<br>James’s meaning is self-evident. Unless he is really injured, he will not refuse to fight. In addition, James also said that he should play more when he is still fit to play, because he didn’t have to play after retirement: “I am healthy, and I will play. I may not play basketball for 45 years James finally said.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/I refuse to take turns! The Lakers made a great decision to win James seven times in a row and announced their retirement time/3b99ece194e741e8834cf00a2ed2301f.jpg" alt="I refuse to take turns! The Lakers made a great decision to win James seven times in a row and announced their retirement time"><br>James also supported Leonard in the end, if he was injured he should not play. No matter the fine or no fine and no injury, it’s better to play and cherish the game.</p>

    <title>If the boss is not here, he will be the first in the East! I&#39;m sorry warrior, you&#39;re only at the bottom of the West</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In an NBA regular season game that ended on the morning of November 22, the Bucks faced the Blazers at home. The Bucks had won five consecutive games, with the same record as Celtic, 11-3, tied for the first place in the East. The Blazers, who lost 8 in 10 games, have now fallen to the second lowest position in the West. The Blazers, spurs and warriors occupied the third lowest position in the West. It seems that there is no big suspense in such a game, and the process is breathtaking! 137-129, trailblazers were 16 points behind, without Lillard. In the fourth quarter, they were only 2 points behind! I’m sorry, warrior. As for the strength at this stage, you can only be at the bottom in the West.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/If the boss is not here, he will be the first in the East! I'm sorry warrior, you're only at the bottom of the West/0319b17ce47041f8bb52b0f670dc8bce.jpg" alt="If the boss is not here, he will be the first in the East! I&#39;m sorry warrior, you&#39;re only at the bottom of the West"><br>In terms of data, on the pioneer side, hood scored 11 points, Anthony scored 18 points and 7 rebounds, mclem scored 37 points and 10 assists, Trent scored 13 points, and Rabbi Sier scored 22 points and 12 rebounds. On the Bucks’ side, Matthews scored 12 points, alphanum scored 24 points, 19 rebounds, 15 assists, Lopez scored 10 points, Devon qinzuo scored 16 points, 6 rebounds, and bradso scored 30 points, 6 assists.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/If the boss is not here, he will be the first in the East! I'm sorry warrior, you're only at the bottom of the West/7f7c8b4aa181419a9a6f89b4e18db61d.jpg" alt="If the boss is not here, he will be the first in the East! I&#39;m sorry warrior, you&#39;re only at the bottom of the West"><br>In the first half, the Bucks firmly held the advantage. In the first half, brother, Bradshaw and Matthews scored three points in a row, which directly opened the difference. Then, mclem and Anthony scored three points in a row, and the Blazers leveled the difference 12-2 after a wave. But at the end of the Festival, the Bucks relied on hill and Connaughton’s three points to expand the lead to double digits, 37-27. In the second quarter, rabisier broke out, while the Bucks relied on Matthews’ three points to respond, Anthony and mclem scored another three points at the end, and the Bucks led the Blazers 72-58 at half-time. In the third quarter, the trailblazers scored 4-3 points in 4 minutes, and the difference reached a single digit. Later, brother lettered opened the breakthrough mode to bombard the paint area continuously, and bucks opened the difference again with a wave of 8-0.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/If the boss is not here, he will be the first in the East! I'm sorry warrior, you're only at the bottom of the West/62247f68d1814d75a0683457e738fa24.jpg" alt="If the boss is not here, he will be the first in the East! I&#39;m sorry warrior, you&#39;re only at the bottom of the West"><br>At the end of the third quarter, the Blazers 98-107 fell behind the bucks. In the fourth quarter, the Blazers were not impatient, so they put the bucks on the outside line. Relying on the 4 points of big Lopez and alphabet brother, the Bucks still took the lead, but the Blazers also made a wave of small climax. Betsmore ‘ It’s a 13-2 climax in two minutes, and there’s no way to get the bucks! At the critical moment, the unreasonable part of the Bucks came again. Big Lopez scored two three points in a row. Matthews also scored three points in the distance. The Bucks reopened the gap. But this kind of immortal ball is really difficult to defend. But to stand up to the last moment with bucks proves the tenacity of this pioneer. In the first quarter of yesterday, he was defeated. That’s impossible.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/If the boss is not here, he will be the first in the East! I'm sorry warrior, you're only at the bottom of the West/06bc94e534b04aee988fdb862deb4b2e.jpg" alt="If the boss is not here, he will be the first in the East! I&#39;m sorry warrior, you&#39;re only at the bottom of the West"><br>Wang Shipeng said he was surprised when evaluating the performance of the pioneers. After all, there are many injuries in this team, even the core Lillard can’t play. The team has got many players this summer, and still needs to break in time. But I believe they won’t always be in the back position in the West, and their strength is still there.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/If the boss is not here, he will be the first in the East! I'm sorry warrior, you're only at the bottom of the West/d2107b6382f74f0e96a695549b6516ea.jpg" alt="If the boss is not here, he will be the first in the East! I&#39;m sorry warrior, you&#39;re only at the bottom of the West"><br>After this game, the Blazers are 5-11, only higher than warriors in the whole west, in other words, they are at the bottom hand in hand with warriors. But to be honest, there is still a big gap between the warriors and the pioneers. Russell has been absent for a long time. Green seems to have no big problem now, but basically he doesn’t play without playing. The warriors only have a few second round shows and draft picks left. The warriors are completely down this season. Br even directly turns the probability of warriors entering the playoffs into 0!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/If the boss is not here, he will be the first in the East! I'm sorry warrior, you're only at the bottom of the West/3e04d19dfe8a45b7ab1a41b603c98342.jpg" alt="If the boss is not here, he will be the first in the East! I&#39;m sorry warrior, you&#39;re only at the bottom of the West"><br>In this way, the strength of the second from the bottom in the west is still very strong. I’m sorry, warrior. In the west, you can only take the bottom.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>On the morning of November 21, a regular season NBA game ended. Timberwolves played jazz at home. Before the game, Timberwolves coach Sanders revealed that Wiggins decided to play in the game, while Oakie and Napier were both missing. Before that, Wiggins missed three games in a row due to the death of his grandmother and his illness. The Timberwolves were 1-2. This time, I still face the Jazz I just met the day before yesterday. 95-103, Timberwolves are defeated! Wiggins seems to have a unique light, where is the focus, today his performance is really remarkable, but his three-point ball, almost to hit the basket crooked.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/In the comeback war, 1 out of 10, got 22 points! Wiggins, are you still not the eldest of the Timberwolves/7d3cb07fc30947e2985d2128dbcabd9d.jpg" alt="In the comeback war, 1 out of 10, got 22 points! Wiggins, are you still not the eldest of the Timberwolves"><br>In terms of data, for the Timberwolves, Downes scored 14 points and 12 rebounds, Covington 11 points and 3 rebounds, Wiggins 22 points and 7 rebounds and 3 assists, TIG 12 points and 6 assists, and Martin and Calver scored double. Jazz side, Bogdanovic 30 points, gobel 12 points 15 rebounds, Mitchell 26 points 7 rebounds, Conley 16 points 8 assists.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/In the comeback war, 1 out of 10, got 22 points! Wiggins, are you still not the eldest of the Timberwolves/3ac8358609ed42c99b72f9df18420f08.jpg" alt="In the comeback war, 1 out of 10, got 22 points! Wiggins, are you still not the eldest of the Timberwolves"><br>In the first quarter, the two sides fell into a tug of war. The Jazz relied on Bogdan and Mitchell to score in a row, and then hit a wave of 13-0, which stretched the difference to double digits. Then tiger from the Timberwolves made a continuous foul, and Calver made a breakthrough. In the single quarter, the Jazz led by 7 points. In the second quarter, the Timberwolves hit a wave of 6-0 climax, and then the jazz, under the leadership of Conley and Ingels, went back to surpass the score. At this time, Wiggins scored three points, and at the end of half-time, the Jazz led the Timberwolves 48-46.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/In the comeback war, 1 out of 10, got 22 points!

Wiggins, are you still not the eldest of the Timberwolves"><br>In the third quarter, Wiggins won the singles in a row, and the two sides alternately took the lead, while the Jazz relied on the three points of the outside line Ingels and Bogdan to open the difference again, while the Timberwolves relied on Wiggins to bring a wave of climax at the end of the quarter. At the end of the third quarter, the Timberwolves were still 5 points behind. In the fourth key quarter, Martin scored 2-3 points in the row against jazz, while Mitchell led the team to hit a wave of 12-0 climax. In the final stage, Downes hit 3-3 points, and jazz scored 2-3 points. In the final moment, jazz scored 3-3 points in the row. The Timberwolves were unable to win the defeat, and they lost 95-103!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/In the comeback war, 1 out of 10, got 22 points! Wiggins, are you still not the eldest of the Timberwolves/67384e9ba6b94a13a414c2a36e691f40.jpg" alt="In the comeback war, 1 out of 10, got 22 points! Wiggins, are you still not the eldest of the Timberwolves"><br>Wiggins made 10 of 24 pitches today, of which only one in 10 is outside the three-point line. In other words, when Wiggins holds the ball and attacks within the three-point line, the efficiency is terrible! And Wiggins had a lot of long and middle shots today, and he didn’t play much under the basket. Downes is trapped in O’Neal and gobel’s bag. He has only made 10 shots in the whole court. He can’t catch the ball at all! In this case, Wiggins needs to stand up to hold the ball and attract fire! But Wiggins didn’t, even so, Wiggins got 22 points and 7 rebounds, terrible!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/In the comeback war, 1 out of 10, got 22 points! Wiggins, are you still not the eldest of the Timberwolves/02df70ffe0a448e399bc92a3f0c5f3b4.jpg" alt="In the comeback war, 1 out of 10, got 22 points! Wiggins, are you still not the eldest of the Timberwolves"><br>Of course, it’s not a one-man situation. TIG scored 12 points on 2-for-9 shots in this game, including 11 free throws and only 6 assists. The most common scene in the game is tig dribbling for 17 or 18 seconds, then passing out quickly. Wiggins shot three points in a hurry and hit the iron! No, TIG is too slow in the pace of the game. You should know that the effect is very good whether using Calver or Lehmann before, and TIG’s presence makes the forest wolf’s position attack too slow!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/In the comeback war, 1 out of 10, got 22 points! Wiggins, are you still not the eldest of the Timberwolves/14f8da9db81442bba2ff58c3f5a91874.jpg" alt="In the comeback war, 1 out of 10, got 22 points! Wiggins, are you still not the eldest of the Timberwolves"><br>After this battle, the Timberwolves’ record is only 8-7, while the sun behind them is only 7-6. Since the start of the game, the two black horses have gradually faded, and have been thrown away by the top six in the West for a certain distance. In the future, the competition schedule of the Timberwolves is also difficult. Facing the sun at home, after the direct dialogue between the two big black horses, the Timberwolves will start their journey away. Wiggins, take the responsibility of being a leader, and don’t flash in the pan any more!</p>

    <title>James + Leonard + Lillard = 34, sICAM = 76 Who can stand it</title>
    <url>/2019/11/17/James%20+%20Leonard%20+%20Lillard%20=%2034,%20sICAM%20=%2076%20Who%20can%20stand%20it/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>There are not many healthy superstars in the league, including James, Leonard and Lillard, who are barely half of them through their performance in the playoffs last season. What we call a superstar is a man who can lead the team forward at a critical moment. It’s natural to score, isn’t it? But once they meet the Raptors, it’s hard to say.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/James + Leonard + Lillard = 34, sICAM = 76 Who can stand it/d1327018c420468d9026403558c8e2d1.jpg" alt="James + Leonard + Lillard = 34, sICAM = 76 Who can stand it"><br>Before the Raptors challenged the Lakers on the road, Lori and Ibaka were injured when playing pelicans. These two players are the key points of scoring on the offensive side. Ibaka is the core of defense on the inner line. The backup team is very important. When meeting the Lakers’ big team, they can also form the inner line twin towers with Raul. There is no big disadvantage against the Lakers. Lori’s physical quality Very strong, outside defense is not bad, lose these two people, raptor’s offensive and defensive strength greatly reduced, but the Lakers are difficult to win, but their 7 consecutive wins were ended.<br>The fundamental reason is that the two superstars of the Lakers are limited. Although bushmei scored 27 points and it’s easy to play in the inner line of raptors, the main focus is on the defensive end. James only got 13 points in this game. Although he scored three pairs, he was forced to cut three pairs, because he really couldn’t get points. He only had five shots for 15 shots, sent 15 assists, and he only had teammates.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/James + Leonard + Lillard = 34, sICAM = 76 Who can stand it/c7ce47804fc14e3e8b73bc62b0b0942c.jpg" alt="James + Leonard + Lillard = 34, sICAM = 76 Who can stand it"><br>Some fans say it’s easy to score with James’ personal ability. So, does James want to score in this game? But how many points did he actually get? James wanted to score in the last six shots and one shot of the game, but when he wanted to play, he was blocked for two consecutive layups. Who could resist this kind of defense? At the critical moment, James was consumed almost, and the Raptors won.<br>The Raptors played clippers the day after the Lakers, back-to-back. In the game with the Lakers, the two teams took the lead repeatedly. It can be said that they consumed a lot of physical strength of the Raptors, but in this game, the Raptors didn’t retreat, no one took a rest, and even van fleet showed that they had to punish Leonard. In fact, the Raptors did sanction Leonard, and it was really van fleet that did it. In this game, he got 14 points and 8 assists. There were 3 steals. The Raptors made 9 mistakes and forced him to give 9 assists.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/James + Leonard + Lillard = 34, sICAM = 76 Who can stand it/0b94da8089904178a5cf2ee389ea4760.jpg" alt="James + Leonard + Lillard = 34, sICAM = 76 Who can stand it"><br>Although Leonard is also learning to transform gradually, but he has not developed the realm of nine assists on the field. This game is Leonard’s best chance to exercise himself, because from the first ball in the game, the Raptors hit him in the whole field, and even did not give him the chance to observe his teammates’ position, making him release the ball in a hurry, surrounded by 2-3 people, sometimes even 4 people , rush to find the way, find teammates, Leonard 11-for-2, there is no better than James. Although the Raptors lost in the end, the Clippers won the game not easily, superstar Leonard was very tired.<br>It’s the pioneers’ turn. The trailblazers have two guns, and they are all defenders. Theoretically speaking, sICAM can’t defend the outside. He is a power forward, an internal defense assistant, which is effective for James and Leonard, but it may not be so effective for defenders. As long as these two people play in and out, they may be able to break through the Raptors’ defense line, but this expectation is wrong, and lilard can’t break through at all Even with the help of cicham and Gasol, the forward of raptors can only pass the ball. With and without the ball, Jefferson will entangle the whole court. Even van Jordan dare not play in the game.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/James + Leonard + Lillard = 34, sICAM = 76 Who can stand it/4a03989dafb644b690b84efb8575a52e.jpg" alt="James + Leonard + Lillard = 34, sICAM = 76 Who can stand it"><br>Lillard played 37 minutes, scored 9 points on 2 of 12 shots and sent 10 assists. Lillard himself is not an organization type guard. He sent 10 assists in this game. The point is not how broad his vision is, but how fierce he was pinched by the Raptors. Lillard scored two goals in the whole game, all three-point goals, and it can be said to be a forced shot. In the first game, he scored one goal at the beginning, and in the last two minutes of the last game. In the middle period of more than 30 minutes, Lillard didn’t score one goal, or even have a chance to shoot. It’s better than Lillard. Forced shooting is like a super guard who is as simple and casual as sky basketball. One match It’s only 12 shots in the game. It’s estimated that the only team that can do this is the Raptors.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/James + Leonard + Lillard = 34, sICAM = 76 Who can stand it/d39bf7f7c1f047789ec6a4c4c097ed2d.jpg" alt="James + Leonard + Lillard = 34, sICAM = 76 Who can stand it"><br>After these three games, we can say that Raptors are superstar harvesters. The three stars scored 34 points in front of the Raptors and were forced to send out 34 assists. They were all forced. After being attacked, they couldn’t get out. They had to find teammates. However, the star in charge of the Raptors, without two helpers, stood alone and scored 24 points, 16 points and 36 points respectively, contributing 76 people in total. He stood up at the critical moment. In such a comparison, we know how good the team’s targeted defense is.<br>Raptor’s road trip is not over yet. Next, we will play lone ranger. Let’s see if the lone ranger twins can escape the dragon claw of Raptor?</p>

The west is in chaos"><br>In fact, the first three quarters, the king to suppress the rhythm of the game, Rubio due to back spasm missed the last game after the comeback, the feel is very poor, 7 0 only get 1 point! Throughout the first half, Dalglish led the Suns 62-45. After entering the third quarter, the king’s stable internal and external multi-point flowering once played the score, berecha’s three points, Barnes’s three points, the king once opened the difference to 26 points! Originally thought that the game completely lost suspense, did not expect the sun did not give up, began to chase the long way!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Insurance 26 points reverse!

The west is in chaos"><br>Booker even took eight points, rookie Johnson also three points, the sun third quarter hit a wave of 15-5 climax, with a 12 point disadvantage into the last quarter.

Kaminsky continued to hit three points, 94-106, berecha layup score, after 2 + 1 of ubre, Booker layup also, 99-108! Three more points for Joseph, 99-111!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Insurance 26 points reverse! Two black horse immortals fight and chase 9 points in the last 2 minutes.

Bridge two penalty all, Ferrer two penalty all, three points again, 108-113! One of Joseph’s two penalties, Cameron Johnson’s make-up shot, Hilde’s two penalties, 110-116!

Two black horse immortals fight and chase 9 points in the last 2 minutes. The west is in chaos"><br>It’s terrible. The sun was 26 points behind! This season’s sun is shining. It’s a pity to lose 1 point to nuggets and 1 point to Utah. It’s no surprise to lose to Miami. It’s really a match. But the Lakers lost the game later. They got involved with their opponents until the last moment. They lost to Celtic and Rubio. What they should win and what they should lose since the start of the game! But it is undeniable that sun’s opponents are very strong! In 13 games, they successively played nuggets, clippers, jazz, 76ers, Lakers, nets, Celtics, and achieved 7-6 results. They are still in the top eight in the west, which is really worthy of respect! Not surprisingly, the sun has gone their way, they can only enter the top eight.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Insurance 26 points reverse!

In the last eight games, he has won 6 victories. There are many strong teams such as jazz and Celtic. The two lost games are also lost to raptors and Lakers. Six victories have made them leap from the bottom of the west to the ninth in the west, just a foot away from the playoffs!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Insurance 26 points reverse!

    <title>Lakers, I don&#39;t want to rotate! James&#39; bodyguard asked the manager to fight, but Rondo was verbally criticized</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>This summer, the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers have undoubtedly become the big winners in the west, one of them has Leonard and George’s combination, the other has Davis. The team has two superstars, and has a celebrity analysis. The biggest hidden danger for clippers and Lakers to win the title in the new season is injury. However, the clippers and the Lakers use different methods. The Clippers keep taking turns, while the Lakers are not prepared to take turns. It’s worth mentioning that the clippers were also punished by the League for taking Leonard off duty.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Lakers, I don't want to rotate! James' bodyguard asked the manager to fight, but Rondo was verbally criticized/2fbd6873d60d4fc19a4a77df85af68bd.jpg" alt="Lakers, I don&#39;t want to rotate! James&#39; bodyguard asked the manager to fight, but Rondo was verbally criticized"><br>According to the latest NBA statement, the comments of clipper manager Doug rivers and others are inconsistent with Leonard’s health. So the union fined hullennard $50000 for his actions. Today, Michael Jordan is also very dissatisfied with the clipper rotation core. He said that he would tell the hornet players every year: “* * you are paid 82 games, so you should fulfill your obligations * *”<br>Jordan has played 82 games in eight seasons in his 15 years of career, leading the league in terms of playing time from 1986 to 1989. Kenbawalker has only missed six games in his four seasons with the Hornets.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Lakers, I don't want to rotate! James' bodyguard asked the manager to fight, but Rondo was verbally criticized/da720847370942b2becd97e603636bab.jpg" alt="Lakers, I don&#39;t want to rotate! James&#39; bodyguard asked the manager to fight, but Rondo was verbally criticized"><br>But compared with the clippers, the Lakers players are eager to come back, even if the injury is not fully recovered. Today, the Lakers updated their injuries, including Bradley and Rondo. In today’s two people have participated in non confrontational training, Lakers coach Vogel revealed. Bradley is 50% likely to be back in tomorrow’s heat game, but he is inclined not to let Bradley come back for more injury.<br>Bradley, however, is stubborn. He said in pre match training today that he plans to come back tomorrow. In the previous game with the Spurs, Bradley left early because of a calf bruise.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Lakers, I don't want to rotate! James' bodyguard asked the manager to fight, but Rondo was verbally criticized/8e365f64d2a248d58a0daf2fd53121b6.jpg" alt="Lakers, I don&#39;t want to rotate! James&#39; bodyguard asked the manager to fight, but Rondo was verbally criticized"><br>Obviously Bradley is too dedicated. He doesn’t want to take turns at will. He just wants to play, just play. Bradley is LeBron James’ bodyguard. When James was in position 1, Bradley was a good player to help him defend. After all, Celtic used Bradley to cover little Thomas to reduce the defensive loopholes. Of course, James’s mobile speed has greatly improved this season, and he can already keep up with the small guard.<br>Bradley is more of Beverly’s role, holding three points in the vacant position, occasionally helping James assist defense, making him more focused on scoring and tandem.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Lakers, I don't want to rotate! James' bodyguard asked the manager to fight, but Rondo was verbally criticized/e883388433364f3cb965eeba35fe3cd5.jpg" alt="Lakers, I don&#39;t want to rotate! James&#39; bodyguard asked the manager to fight, but Rondo was verbally criticized"><br>In addition, the Lakers are not only Bradley, but Rondo, too. According to Lakers reporter Mike Trudell on twitter, Rondo wanted to return to the heat ahead of time, but the Lakers ignored Rondo. They didn’t want the veteran to take a risk, so the Lakers rejected Rondo’s request and may have criticized him for not being too anxious.<br>Mike Trudell also revealed that the Lakers refused Rondo on the safe side and wanted to give him more time to recover. But the Lakers also gave a specific return time. After the heat, the next game for the Lakers is next week’s raptors, in which Rondo will have a chance to return.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Lakers, I don't want to rotate! James' bodyguard asked the manager to fight, but Rondo was verbally criticized/ae48e7b1262f40229d51a1fca2daa2da.jpg" alt="Lakers, I don&#39;t want to rotate! James&#39; bodyguard asked the manager to fight, but Rondo was verbally criticized"><br>In other words, the injuries of Bradley and Rondo are just like they said. They are almost recovered and can play in advance. But the Lakers chose to turn them down and put off another game. And these two people are injured indeed, Lakers have regular reason to let them rest a few more games, but they are still anxious to come back.<br>If Rondo and Bradley come back, the Lakers and Davis and Howard, the two defensive gates, the defense will be improved.</p>

I didn&#39;t expect that old Jordan could find the treasure"><br>In an NBA regular season game that ended on the morning of November 17, the Knicks met the Hornets at home. The difference between the two sides in the East was not significant. Before the Knicks, 3-9, 5-7, but one was in the seventh place and the other was in the last place! As a result, the Knicks were killed by the hornet’s Graham in the last two seconds! It’s unreasonable for the Hornets to beat pistons and Knicks in two back-to-back games!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Last-gasp goal! 3 points in 9!

In addition, Munk and Marvin also scored double. On the Knicks side, little Morris scored 14 points and 6 rebounds, Randall 12 points and 7 rebounds and 6 assists, Barrett 22 points and 5 rebounds, Robinson and Portis also scored double.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Last-gasp goal! 3 points in 9! I didn't expect that old Jordan could find the treasure/a7ae796adcc841b79dc9663e041f9336.jpg" alt="Last-gasp goal! 3 points in 9! I didn&#39;t expect that old Jordan could find the treasure"><br>In fact, after the hornet killed the piston last time, the morale was high, but the whole court was suppressed by the death of Nix. In the first quarter, the Knicks blossomed more points, Gibson’s make-up, Barrett’s chopping, nilikina’s jump shot, while the Hornets relied on Graham and Munk to maintain the situation, with the Knicks leading by 3 points in a single quarter. In the second quarter, the Knicks started with a 7-0 game, while the Hornets still came out with Graham, scoring two and three points in a row, but at the end of the potis Festival, there was another wave of climax. In the half, the Knicks opened the difference to 8 points.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Last-gasp goal! 3 points in 9! I didn't expect that old Jordan could find the treasure/515ef1bba5d74766bccbde601ec3c34e.jpg" alt="Last-gasp goal! 3 points in 9! I didn&#39;t expect that old Jordan could find the treasure"><br>In the second half, the Hornets started the catch-up mode, battum’s three points, Zeller’s three points, then Graham and Munk scored three points in a row. After the Hornets hit back, the difference was only 1 point behind. In the fourth quarter, Graham continued to hit three points, while the Knicks used Robinson’s basket to kill the uncertain situation. Rosier led the team to play a wave of 7-0, re equalizing the difference. At the last moment, the Knicks led by two points, Graham took the ball directly to pull out three points, bombed in, and Knicks lost!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Last-gasp goal! 3 points in 9! I didn't expect that old Jordan could find the treasure/880a6d6d50f84352a9a1a818d34b796f.jpg" alt="Last-gasp goal! 3 points in 9! I didn&#39;t expect that old Jordan could find the treasure"><br>Terrible! Graham scored nine three-point goals in the game. He’s only 24! As the 34th player selected by the Hornets in 2018, in rookie year last season, the average playing time is only 14.8 minutes, only 4.7 points + 2.6 assists! He is only the third choice after Walker and Parker. This summer, Walker left the team, Parker retired, Hornets because the team salary space is not enough, there is no big action, only get Rozier, Graham has become a team rotation.<br>I didn’t expect that after entering the rotation, Graham played better and better. He has contributed 18 points + 7.5 assists + 3.5 rebounds per game, and hit 3.1 three-point goals per game. Since then, he has successfully entered the starting line, which is his third official starting line!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Last-gasp goal! 3 points in 9! I didn't expect that old Jordan could find the treasure/bcf5277339864d8ea54e26b7fddd1df2.jpg" alt="Last-gasp goal! 3 points in 9! I didn&#39;t expect that old Jordan could find the treasure"><br>As we all know, the Hornets have been wandering beyond the threshold of the eastern playoffs. Jordan has spent a lot of money, but the people he chose are endless. Bieyongbo, with an annual salary of 17 million, can’t even compete with the rotation. Mikki has been out of action with a high salary of 13 million. Batum has a top salary of 25.57 million dollars, but I didn’t expect that the Hornets can also have players like Graham, With an annual salary of $1.42 million, I do the work of top paid players! The old man should keep him.</p>

However, with the departure of the team’s frontline players, such as Aminu and hackers, the exploiter’s performance in the new season is bleak.

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In an NBA regular season game that ended on the morning of November 19, the Raptors faced the Hornets at home, fourth in the East and eighth in the East, and the Raptors couldn’t play Lori. 132-96, another NBA tragedy was born. The Raptors won 36 points at home. Is the competitiveness of the east so weak?<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/NBA massacre! 36 points, give the East 8th face! Is leonard the same/28ee3e9dc54f43c8a08707f7f98db216.jpg" alt="NBA massacre! 36 points, give the East 8th face! Is leonard the same"><br>Data, the Hornets side, bridges 13 points 5 rebounds, Graham 11 points 6 assists, Rozier 10 points 3 assists, in addition to Marvin and bieyongbo scores are double. On the Raptors’ side, anunuobi has 24 points and 5 rebounds, sikam has 20 points and 8 rebounds, Powell has 17 points and 6 assists, and van fried has 11 points and 8 assists.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/NBA massacre! 36 points, give the East 8th face! Is leonard the same/9d03fdbc1e974f2d88428d4b6a6d253b.jpg" alt="NBA massacre! 36 points, give the East 8th face! Is leonard the same"><br>In the first half, the Raptors and the Hornets were equally matched. After the Raptors got the 7-0 start, Graham helped the Hornets to hit three points, then the two sides roared three points each other, and with the help of van freett’s sudden inward and outward shot, the Raptors pulled the difference back to 8 points, and the Hornets’ 6-0 climax at the end of the quarter wiped out the difference! At the beginning of the second quarter, the Hornets relied on byyongbo and Washington to quickly surpass the score, and the two sides fell into a tug of war. Byyongbo scored seven points in a row at the end of the second quarter, and raptors led the Hornets by four points at half time with three points from Xiaojia and a breakthrough from anuobi.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/NBA massacre! 36 points, give the East 8th face! Is leonard the same/474cdaef39774d3a89065d191df1d925.jpg" alt="NBA massacre! 36 points, give the East 8th face! Is leonard the same"><br>After the second half, the wasp died in a flash! Anunobil scored three points in a row, sikam ate alone in a row, and the Raptors reached a 24-11 climax to open the difference. Then van freet and Pau Gasol hit five three-point goals in a row. The difference was already 20 points, and the Hornets couldn’t hold it! In the fourth quarter, the Raptors continued to feel hot. Matt Thomas and Davis scored another 5-3 points. The Hornets surrendered in exchange for all the main players. The score was set at 132-96!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/NBA massacre! 36 points, give the East 8th face! Is leonard the same/6f81ba9faa7d497eba04422e4dd24737.jpg" alt="NBA massacre! 36 points, give the East 8th face! Is leonard the same"><br>Terrible! The game schedule of raptors is very difficult. Just after a trip to the west, they played against the Lakers clipper pioneer lone ranger in a row. Then they came back to the home court and only had a day off to play the Hornets. In addition, during this period, they have been short of Lori, Pau Gasol’s injury and stop. In fact, there are four players that Raptors can play. SICAM, van fritt, anunoby and Powell are the rest It’s fresh blood, like Davis, Bucher and Thomas, who may not have their place in any other team, but in raptors, when the team is in urgent need of people, everyone can contribute their energy.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/NBA massacre! 36 points, give the East 8th face! Is leonard the same/59528a952c284109ad39b21d966d7d3d.jpg" alt="NBA massacre! 36 points, give the East 8th face! Is leonard the same"><br>Since Leonard left, sICAM has been promoted to the position of power forward. Raptors have just renewed his contract with him. In four years, 130 million US dollars, compared with last season’s average of 16.9 + 6.9 + 3.1, Sica’s data has soared to 26.2 + 8.7 + 4.1 this season, which has become one of the first-line superstars. What’s more, his efficiency is very high, 46.9% shooting rate, 35.1% three-point life Medium rate, tie-in with van freet’s outside control, this brand-new Raptor is quite competitive!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/NBA massacre! 36 points, give the East 8th face! Is leonard the same/aa9a26a6a48740f6b020a84329320a6e.jpg" alt="NBA massacre! 36 points, give the East 8th face! Is leonard the same"><br>We need to know that although the opponent wasp’s record is 6-8, it is also the top eight in the East, but the eastern strength gap is very large, the first six are the only one, and the last nine teams are the first. The Raptors’ crushing and crushing of the wasp actually proves their strength. After this game, raptors continued to rank fourth in the East with 9 wins and 4 losses. Compared with the same period last year, there was almost no change in the record. It may be seen from the record, whether there is Leonard is the same, but it is certain that Leonard’s role in the playoffs is irreplaceable. Now sICAM is trying to improve himself in the regular season. The top limit of raptors is actually on him.</p>

    <title>Only 17 points for 20 shots, 0 extra time contribution + 2 mistakes! I&#39;m sorry, Leonard. You don&#39;t look like a boss</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In the NBA regular season, which ended at noon on November 21, after overtime, the clipper narrowly beat Celtic 107-104, which was called the playoff level. But teacher Yang Yi felt that this was the most wonderful game in the NBA this season, called the finals level! To be sure, the level of players of both sides is absolutely at the level of the finals. The combination debut of Xiao Ka and Paojiao, the strong defense of Celtic over there, including indomitable game toughness, even if the clipper hit two waves of 8-0 climax in the last moment, it was difficult to win in overtime! Embarrassed, Leonard doesn’t seem to be in shape.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Only 17 points for 20 shots, 0 extra time contribution + 2 mistakes! I'm sorry, Leonard. You don't look like a boss/e0211604ff424107a495a8f6b82bdf0b.jpg" alt="Only 17 points for 20 shots, 0 extra time contribution + 2 mistakes! I&#39;m sorry, Leonard. You don&#39;t look like a boss"><br>Leonard played 38 minutes today, 7 of 20 shots, only 17 points, 6 rebounds, 3 assists, 3 steals, and 5 mistakes. In fact, Yang Yi said that when summarizing Leonard, Leonard took 20 shots today to get 17 points. For players of his level, the efficiency is very low! First, there is no free throw, lack of internal kill; second, Leonard made too many active mistakes today, dribbling mistakes, passing was broken, including the last moment was pulled out of the boundary by matterson after kicking out, Leonard today is completely prevented by matterson!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Only 17 points for 20 shots, 0 extra time contribution + 2 mistakes! I'm sorry, Leonard. You don't look like a boss/3e4cd04ec10f4f0982a366b902c1a70e.jpg" alt="Only 17 points for 20 shots, 0 extra time contribution + 2 mistakes! I&#39;m sorry, Leonard. You don&#39;t look like a boss"><br>In fact, Leonard and pickled peppers first match, the biggest point is how the two brothers coexist. Rivers is to let Paojiao play point guard, Leonard continues to play small forward, in the game one of the two always in the strong side, the other play weak side! When Leonard was present, Leonard dominated, while when Leonard went down to rest, pickled peppers dominated. To be honest, the efficiency of the first three quarters is very average, but just after Leonard went down to rest in the middle of the fourth quarter, when Paojiao took Harrell, Beverly, Lowe and harkles to play together, the clipper returned to the familiar rhythm of the clipper: Beverly’s three points, Harrell’s slam dunk, Lowe’s three points, the first two balls, Paojiao took the initiative to block Lowe Open, and give teammates open space, and the last goal, is really by the personal ability of Luwei! A wave of 8-0, smoothing the difference!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Only 17 points for 20 shots, 0 extra time contribution + 2 mistakes! I'm sorry, Leonard. You don't look like a boss/2b1e97de6247483cbd609cc1efc37f32.jpg" alt="Only 17 points for 20 shots, 0 extra time contribution + 2 mistakes! I&#39;m sorry, Leonard. You don&#39;t look like a boss"><br>Leonard is a little embarrassed! So it’s time to come back. When Leonard came up, Celtic scored four points in a row, and the score was pulled back! Teacher Yang Yi joked: who can be in a hurry? Leonard let off steam, but that’s all he did in the fourth quarter and overtime! And his last-minute kill in his regular time also made Mr. Yang Yi question: jump inside, what three points should be cast at this time?<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Only 17 points for 20 shots, 0 extra time contribution + 2 mistakes! I'm sorry, Leonard. You don't look like a boss/7eff8328281a43d88e3c175e06ab33f5.jpg" alt="Only 17 points for 20 shots, 0 extra time contribution + 2 mistakes! I&#39;m sorry, Leonard. You don&#39;t look like a boss"><br>In extra time, Leonard let Tatum dunk easily under the basket because of missing people. At the last moment, Leonard was beaten out of the line by smart. In extra time, Leonard had only one shot, and the extra time included the last quarter of the fourth quarter, which was all sustained by Beverly and Lowell. Of course, Paojiao also hit a three-point mark.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Only 17 points for 20 shots, 0 extra time contribution + 2 mistakes! I'm sorry, Leonard. You don't look like a boss/cf33dbeaf5cc45f3a9be5facf434964a.jpg" alt="Only 17 points for 20 shots, 0 extra time contribution + 2 mistakes! I&#39;m sorry, Leonard. You don&#39;t look like a boss"><br>No, this is definitely not the strength of xiaoka! To be honest, Leonard has changed a little bit today when kajiao was on the court at the same time. It’s important to know that in the post spurs period, including the Raptors period, Leonard has always been a single core team leader. When it comes to the clippers, not only Paojiao, but also Luwei is actually the core of the team. Leonard’s right to play has been stripped. Although Leonard is a tough defender and is good at playing without the ball, after all, now It’s also a superstar. With other super giants, Leonard seems to be a little timid, not aggressive enough, and not in control of the game!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Only 17 points for 20 shots, 0 extra time contribution + 2 mistakes! I'm sorry, Leonard. You don't look like a boss/36c66f3d15b142c3a8e486c46dbc0ca2.jpg" alt="Only 17 points for 20 shots, 0 extra time contribution + 2 mistakes! I&#39;m sorry, Leonard. You don&#39;t look like a boss"><br>Of course, it’s just a game. I hope Leonard can adjust his hand and mind. Clipper is indeed the top in the league. Even without pickled peppers and small cards, it’s the Western playoff level. Let’s see what Beverly has become like. Let’s see the heart of Luwei and the dominance of Harrell in the inner line! Run in well, definitely the sword finger championship, run in well, you may become the next Celtic, the Celtic in the past two years.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Los Angeles Lakers won. They won 7 straight home games today, beating the heat 95-80. It’s also the first seven straight wins of the Lakers’ regular season in eight years. It looks like the Lakers will keep winning. Their chemistry is satisfying now, and the Lakers can come back no matter how many points they are behind. Now the Lakers give people a feeling that they are very stable. When they meet a strong team, they can grind hard by defense. They have a lot of players who can fight hard. Howard + Davis + Green + Bradley, the Lakers have a lot of defenders. And the atmosphere is fantastic and the players are very motivated.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Only 7 points in 3 of 9, plus or minus - 11. Kuzmaasai apologized publicly and made a promise/dbae9186f1234009b9350ecbe411265c.jpg" alt="Only 7 points in 3 of 9, plus or minus - 11. Kuzmaasai apologized publicly and made a promise"><br>After today’s game, Kuzma was also very dissatisfied with his performance and apologized publicly to reflect on himself. Today, Kuzma came off the bench and got 7 points and 5 rebounds from 3-for-9 shots in 25 minutes. The positive and negative values are - 11. It’s obvious that Kuzma seems to have lost his former edge because of his deep friendship with her boss, Jennifer bass. Now he seems to be short of energy, and injuries are frequent, unable to find the state.<br>Kuzma also said in an interview that he hoped the Lakers would give him some time to recover the attack. In addition, Kuzma also made a promise for the Lakers that he would continue to improve defense without delay.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Only 7 points in 3 of 9, plus or minus - 11.

Kuzmaasai apologized publicly and made a promise"><br>Kuzma’s defense in the Lakers last season wasn’t that bad because everyone was average. But this season, the Lakers have a number of defense players, Kuzma such a comparison really think defense is not good. Even at the defensive end, Kuzma is worse than McGee.<br>“I need time now, I need a process,” Kuzma said. I haven’t found my shooting touch yet. Today, I had a bad performance. Thank you for winning the game. But I’ll try to find my hand. I will try my best on the defensive side. I’m trying to contribute to the team at the other end when the attack is not going well. Enter the role at the defensive end. It’s the way we win now. I have to keep up<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Only 7 points in 3 of 9, plus or minus - 11.

Kuzmaasai apologized publicly and made a promise"><br>In fact, as LeBron James said, it’s a process to recover the injury. James lost his explosive power at the offensive end after he was injured last season, and the defensive end couldn’t move. This season, James began to return to his former form. Today, James also announced that he has completely recovered from his former form. His speed is faster than last season, and his physical fitness is better.<br>Today, James played 35 minutes and got 25 points, 4 rebounds and 6 assists from 10 of 19 shots.

He uses red wine as a metaphor. James thinks his life is still very long. It also mentions Leonard’s rotation. James thinks he can play as long as he is healthy. Because he may not play basketball for 45 years. So now he will cherish the present, play the last glory of his career and play more games.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Only 7 points in 3 of 9, plus or minus - 11.

I know that many people in the social media now say that I am the angry emperor. But you know I can only prove myself with action. As for the rotation, when I was in Cleveland, when I was back-to-back, Tyrone Lou always wanted me to rotate, and I wanted to play. Because I may not play basketball for 45 years! “</p>

    <title>Please be careful green! 30 + 7 in 35 minutes, seven in a row! Warrior only you can leave with your head held high</title>
    <url>/2019/11/23/Please%20be%20careful%20green!%2030%20+%207%20in%2035%20minutes,%20seven%20in%20a%20row!%20Warrior%20only%20you%20can%20leave%20with%20your%20head%20held%20high/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>The pelicans play warriors at home in an NBA regular season game that ends on the morning of November 18. The situation of this game is very clear: the warriors win, or the last one, but the warriors lose, you can completely consolidate your position of the last one! 100-108, the warriors suffered seven consecutive defeats, the first time in Cole’s time, but I believe this is not the only time, because the road is still long. Of course, the warrior was defeated. There was a man who could leave with his head held high. Because he tried his best, he was the only cover for the warrior.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Please be careful green! 30 + 7 in 35 minutes, seven in a row! Warrior only you can leave with your head held high/cb27aa356185487b8c14f2a4f4336834.jpg" alt="Please be careful green! 30 + 7 in 35 minutes, seven in a row! Warrior only you can leave with your head held high"><br>Pascal, 35 minutes, 10 of 17, 30 points, 7 rebounds, 2 assists, plus or minus 3, the team’s highest. What does this mean?<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Please be careful green! 30 + 7 in 35 minutes, seven in a row! Warrior only you can leave with your head held high/093fbf199aec42608fa807df95d908e3.jpg" alt="Please be careful green! 30 + 7 in 35 minutes, seven in a row! Warrior only you can leave with your head held high"><br>From the first quarter, the warriors were very passive. They were played 5-0 at the beginning. Stamford played. Green’s attack level was just like that. Berks didn’t feel it. Pascal was the only one! Break the layup, mid-range jump shot, basket shot, 45 degrees three points, 10 points and 2 rebounds in a single quarter! In the second quarter, besieged by Green’s squeeze into the small forward position, Pascal’s hit rate dropped, but still got 6 points and 1 rebound, and 3 free throws. To be sure, Pascal is the most stable scoring point of this warrior. Cole really wants to give him time to hone it, but there is a dream chasing green in the middle.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Please be careful green! 30 + 7 in 35 minutes, seven in a row! Warrior only you can leave with your head held high/5244ab8c45854d49998e66da7d055262.jpg" alt="Please be careful green! 30 + 7 in 35 minutes, seven in a row! Warrior only you can leave with your head held high"><br>In the third quarter, Pascal played for 12 minutes. Pascal, who returned to position 4, made continuous use of breakthrough to create damage, made three layups for four times, and caused opponents’ fouls. In addition, Cole let Pascal partner Chris, Bowman and Spelman’s replacement lineup at the end of the quarter, which also allowed warriors to recover many points in the third quarter,<br>After Pascal came back to the stage in the fourth quarter, Bowman, together, once chased the difference to only 5 points! Inside the strong hit, empty cut layup, the whole field under 30 points, two solutions: This is the warrior’s first thigh ah!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Please be careful green! 30 + 7 in 35 minutes, seven in a row! Warrior only you can leave with your head held high/52c2f0b7b9da444da9ff390a11eaa3c5.jpg" alt="Please be careful green! 30 + 7 in 35 minutes, seven in a row! Warrior only you can leave with your head held high"><br>To be honest, Pascal is lucky to get so many chances in rookie season as a second round show this summer! In other words, he can use these opportunities to prove that he also has the conditions to become a star. Pascal averaged 15.6 points + 4.6 rebounds + 1.3 assists in the first 12 games of this season. He is the most efficient player in this Warriors team. He is only 23 years old!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Please be careful green! 30 + 7 in 35 minutes, seven in a row! Warrior only you can leave with your head held high/2fedcf7eeffa4db6aff7a7598d527c7f.jpg" alt="Please be careful green! 30 + 7 in 35 minutes, seven in a row! Warrior only you can leave with your head held high"><br>But now Cole has a problem in his use. If he really wants to put Pascal in the position he likes, green will become redundant. But green is on the court, both ends of attack and defense are far less than Pascal. Take today’s game as an example, in 2 of 10, Pelican would rather prevent Robinson and Burke from hitting, than waste more time on green! Is it true that Cole has to give up an all star and warrior who just renewed his contract for $100 million for the past five years?<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Please be careful green! 30 + 7 in 35 minutes, seven in a row! Warrior only you can leave with your head held high/19f2cb86fc79450c991e4d8e583155de.jpg" alt="Please be careful green! 30 + 7 in 35 minutes, seven in a row! Warrior only you can leave with your head held high"><br>Of course, the best way for warriors at this stage is to continue to give Pascal more opportunities and more time, but it does threaten green. As we all know, Durant and green overtly fell out last season. To put it bluntly, it’s just for the money. Green needs to stay in the warriors to maximize his value, and Durant is the value of the top salary no matter where he goes, so green has been challenging. In the end, Durant left as he wished, and Gerin got a big contract.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Please be careful green! 30 + 7 in 35 minutes, seven in a row! Warrior only you can leave with your head held high/109c17552f124d3ba2f3b33f94e3be0e.jpg" alt="Please be careful green! 30 + 7 in 35 minutes, seven in a row! Warrior only you can leave with your head held high"><br>Seriously, Pascal is now threatening green. Is green going to be in a bad mood? Of course, we can’t speculate, but we sincerely hope that the warriors will have fewer dressing room disputes. In the past, there has been enough chaos. Give these young players more opportunities!</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Pelicans take on the heat away from home. Pelican is too difficult, most of the main players don’t play, Ingram, Jermain, Hart, Zion, okafu, Redick don’t play, that is to say Pelican let a starting line-up to challenge the heat. The heat are waiting for work, in theory, to win this game is very easy, just a little defensive strength is enough.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Plus or minus up to + 22! 16 + 8 + 13 + 3 + 6 in 37 minutes, he took over the game in the last quarter/951a91930e1241fd8ae33df2b3487a0e.jpg" alt="Plus or minus up to + 22! 16 + 8 + 13 + 3 + 6 in 37 minutes, he took over the game in the last quarter"><br>In the first quarter, both sides played smoothly at the beginning of the game, because both sides did not show their defensive attitude, strength and hardness. Pelican is throwing when he comes here. Holliday can throw three points with the chance of single block, and other pitchers can easily get close to the vacancy. Pelican attack is not unique, Holliday is not unique, so other players like to share the ball. The heat play fast on the counter attack, pelican’s back defense is very bad, Butler in the face of Holliday is not easy to play, but other players attack without any pressure. Played more than 5 minutes, both sides did not make a mistake, no rebounds in the front court, it seems very harmonious. With the pelican’s hit rate down, the heat opened the score to 6 points with a quick attack and defense switch. Both Holliday and Butler finished the first quarter, with the pelicans trailing 7 points, 22-29.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Plus or minus up to + 22! 16 + 8 + 13 + 3 + 6 in 37 minutes, he took over the game in the last quarter/54103473b66b4f95a7e08489177569a3.jpg" alt="Plus or minus up to + 22! 16 + 8 + 13 + 3 + 6 in 37 minutes, he took over the game in the last quarter"><br>In the second quarter of the game, when the two sides went down, the heat and Pelican had problems in the offensive end, and errors began to increase, and they could not play a good chance in the attack. The heat had Adebayor in the inner line to blow up the basket, the pelican in the outer line had walker to shoot three points, and both teams were struggling to maintain the score by scoring points that were not tactical. After Butler came back, he led the team to play a 7-0 game to extend the difference to 10 points, which is actually an advantage based on defense. After Holliday came back, pelican’s attack improved significantly. The series attack + three-point shooting, more than one minute hit a wave of 9-0 to narrow the difference. In the last five seconds, the heat used a pressure whistle to stabilize the difference at five points, and the two sides fought 49-54.<br>In the third quarter of the game, the two sides fought another five minutes in disorder, and the difference between the points was not pulled back, which was kept within 4 points. When Holliday went down to rest, the pelican’s attack was even more disordered. After two points’ rest, he went back to the field, but was caught by the heat in a wide range, so he couldn’t hold the ball to attack, and his teammates were not sure. Especially at this time, Holliday would miss England very much Graeme, because the pelican now has no one other than Holliday who can hold the ball to create an attack.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Plus or minus up to + 22! 16 + 8 + 13 + 3 + 6 in 37 minutes, he took over the game in the last quarter/8bb8757565584eb88a308488aeb2572a.jpg" alt="Plus or minus up to + 22! 16 + 8 + 13 + 3 + 6 in 37 minutes, he took over the game in the last quarter"><br>The heat’s grip has achieved good results. They played defense and counterattack. Butler kept the ball to the basket or hit the basket continuously, and got a lot of gains. The heat pulled the difference to 10 points in a short time. The pelican was in trouble and had to ask for a pause. Still in the last minute of the third quarter, the heat, relying on improving the intensity of defense, made a beautiful attack and defense conversion, and pulled the difference to 13 points.<br>At the end of the game, Pelican hit four three-point shots in a row on the outside line. Although they didn’t defend well and didn’t defend the heat when they scored, Pelican scored three points and the heat only scored two points. The difference between them has been narrowing. Butler came back in eight minutes, batting Holliday for three consecutive rounds, holding the 10 point gap. In the last five minutes, the heat strengthened the defense against the pelican, the outside line let them throw, the front line and the inside line firmly refused to let them in, at the same time, strengthened Butler’s personal attack, controlled the rhythm, played the success rate, finally the heat defeated the pelican at home, both sides played 109-94.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Plus or minus up to + 22! 16 + 8 + 13 + 3 + 6 in 37 minutes, he took over the game in the last quarter/9d59a716fbc04de0b6eae3743ca40b8c.jpg" alt="Plus or minus up to + 22! 16 + 8 + 13 + 3 + 6 in 37 minutes, he took over the game in the last quarter"><br>In the whole game, Butler played 37 minutes, 4 of 11 shots, 2 of 3 pointers, 1 of 2 shots, 16 points, 8 rebounds, 13 assists, 3 steals, 6 mistakes, plus or minus 22. Butler was very well defended by Holliday in the first three quarters of the game, and his hand feeling was very poor. But he stood out at the last critical moment, fought hard through his personal ability, played back at the low post, and then distributed the ball to his teammates to attack in series after being sandwiched, bringing up the rhythm of the whole team. Despite the lack of drajic, the offensive end is not so orderly, but with Butler’s strong personal ability to win the game, but it is more difficult.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Plus or minus up to + 22! 16 + 8 + 13 + 3 + 6 in 37 minutes, he took over the game in the last quarter/e627b38f2e0444208e962298b96e64af.jpg" alt="Plus or minus up to + 22! 16 + 8 + 13 + 3 + 6 in 37 minutes, he took over the game in the last quarter"><br>On pelican’s side, Holliday made 5 of 12 shots, 5 of 3-pointers, 4 of 5 shots, got 14 points and 4 assists, and sent out 6 mistakes. He didn’t continue to play the Clippers. There were too few helpers around him. Pelican’s overall three-point shooting rate is very high, 35 to 16, reaching 45%, but because the opponent can’t be prevented, especially in the critical moment no one can stand out, such a team is most afraid of playing in the critical moment, most afraid of playing in the last game, and is doomed to go not far.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Positive and negative value first in the whole game! Eight games out of the third largest Lakers, performance crushing Kuzma Warcraft/0ec286ee7df349d594fd7385605197d4.jpg" alt="Positive and negative value first in the whole game! Eight games out of the third largest Lakers, performance crushing Kuzma Warcraft"><br>On November 9, the Lakers easily beat the heat 95-80 at home today, winning 7 consecutive games. In fact, the attack of the Lakers in this game is not fully opened. Except for James and Davis, the attack efficiency of others is relatively low. Today’s score is even lower than their average score of 16 points. But even so, why can they still easily take away the victory? The reason is simple. It’s because of their first defensive efficiency in the league that the opponent only got 16 points in the fourth quarter.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Positive and negative value first in the whole game! Eight games out of the third largest Lakers, performance crushing Kuzma Warcraft/4bc92c40cc1848299a3ad2ef9eae65e9.jpg" alt="Positive and negative value first in the whole game! Eight games out of the third largest Lakers, performance crushing Kuzma Warcraft"><br>This game, James and Davis are still showing strong dominance. First of all, he has obviously reduced his inefficient long-range shots today, hit the basket as much as possible, and strengthened his mid-range shot. In the end, he made 11 of 17 shots, missed three-point shots, scored 26 points, 8 rebounds, 7 assists, 2 steals and 3 blocks, which is very comprehensive. Next is James. He obviously didn’t work hard today, but he still felt hot. He scored 25 points, 4 rebounds and 6 assists in 10 of 19 shots, 7 of 3-pointers and 4 of 7 shots. From the data of only 2 free throws, we can see that James didn’t work hard today.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Positive and negative value first in the whole game! Eight games out of the third largest Lakers, performance crushing Kuzma Warcraft/3ca924994b71435a8ff71fee0a4b44f2.jpg" alt="Positive and negative value first in the whole game! Eight games out of the third largest Lakers, performance crushing Kuzma Warcraft"><br>In addition to Jamie’s team, the best player today is Bradley who just came back. Although he only made 4 of 9 shots and got 9 points, 5 rebounds and 3 assists in the whole game, his positive and negative value is the highest in the whole game, up to + 24. That is to say, when he was on the court, the Lakers won the heat by 24 points. Looking at this data, he was better than James and Davis.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Positive and negative value first in the whole game! Eight games out of the third largest Lakers, performance crushing Kuzma Warcraft/694ddf6e54fb4b5ca3b0f9eb88bfe595.jpg" alt="Positive and negative value first in the whole game! Eight games out of the third largest Lakers, performance crushing Kuzma Warcraft"><br>As an excellent 3D player, Bradley’s role is not just reflected in the data. As long as he is on the court, the overall defense of the Lakers will be upgraded by 1-2 levels. At the same time, he also has a very good three-point ball, and does not occupy the ball right, this type of player is a natural match with Jamie, so now he can sit in the starting line-up of the Lakers.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Positive and negative value first in the whole game! Eight games out of the third largest Lakers, performance crushing Kuzma Warcraft/51634223693f4738a7a86e2bcca908cf.jpg" alt="Positive and negative value first in the whole game! Eight games out of the third largest Lakers, performance crushing Kuzma Warcraft"><br>Ever since the start of the new season, fans have been talking about who is the three leader of the Lakers? Some people think it’s Kuzma, some think it’s Howard, some even think it’s Danny green, but with the deepening of the season, the answer to this question has gradually been revealed automatically.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Positive and negative value first in the whole game! Eight games out of the third largest Lakers, performance crushing Kuzma Warcraft/e2117859702f4e798d67c680b8379192.jpg" alt="Positive and negative value first in the whole game! Eight games out of the third largest Lakers, performance crushing Kuzma Warcraft"><br>Bradley is the team’s third scorer, second only to James and Davis in super giant, with an average of 10.7 points, 3.3 rebounds, 1.3 steals, a hit rate of 51.9% and a three-point hit rate of 35.3%. Obviously, now the post-90s defensive elite has become the team’s third in charge.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Kobe White’s first round of No. 7 this year saw another big break, after a 7-point streak in the last game and 23 points in a single quarter. In the Bulls away game against the Bucks, Kobe white once again became the steadiest scorer in the bulls. In the first half, he shot 19 points in full swing, and scored 5-3 points. In the whole game, white made 9 of 23 shots, 6 of 13 three-point shots, and 2 of 2 free throws, scored 26 points, 5 boards, 3 assists and 3 steals.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Nine goals scored 26 points, 19-year-old rookie broke out again, 2-game wild 13 points too crazy/7effcadefa9e48fbb7a2984afc5bbaa4.jpg" alt="Nine goals scored 26 points, 19-year-old rookie broke out again, 2-game wild 13 points too crazy"><br>In the first quarter, Kobe white scored two times outside the three-point line, continuing the excellent shooting touch of the last game. In the next quarter, Kobe white played a very striking personal performance. He couldn’t stop his inward and outward shots. He shot three points in a row outside the three-point line. He shot five times in seven shots in a single quarter and cut 13 points and 2 boards in three out of five three points.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Nine goals scored 26 points, 19-year-old rookie broke out again, 2-game wild 13 points too crazy/947a430e45b745ebbedffba240fe6213.jpg" alt="Nine goals scored 26 points, 19-year-old rookie broke out again, 2-game wild 13 points too crazy"><br>With Kobe White’s strong output, the bulls were able to lead by a point at the end of the first half. However, in the third quarter, white’s hand fell, 0 in 5 became a big hole, while the Bucks seized the opportunity to play a 32-20 single quarter reversal, which laid the situation. At the end of the game, white played the whole game. The bulls were eager to complete the reversal with his offensive ability and key temperament, but unfortunately, they lost the game 115-124.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Nine goals scored 26 points, 19-year-old rookie broke out again, 2-game wild 13 points too crazy/953adf7be6054bb19cfc25cb74bacd0b.jpg" alt="Nine goals scored 26 points, 19-year-old rookie broke out again, 2-game wild 13 points too crazy"><br>In the last game, 19-year-old Kobe white proved his worth with a superb shooting performance. Today’s World War I, he continued his shooting performance, showing a strong desire to attack. In the Bulls team, which has been at the bottom all year round, Chicago team has changed from one pick to another and built the core of the team, but in recent years, it has not cultivated absolute superstars.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Nine goals scored 26 points, 19-year-old rookie broke out again, 2-game wild 13 points too crazy/22b71112e09840db88f5a73c5038246a.jpg" alt="Nine goals scored 26 points, 19-year-old rookie broke out again, 2-game wild 13 points too crazy"><br>White has scored seven three points and six three points in the last two games. The 19-year-old has a promising future. It may be difficult for the bulls to get out of the doldrums, but among the young talents, white is a very worthy star of tomorrow.</p>

    <title>Refuse to lose in a row! 18-for-8, 19 + 7 + 11, Lakers boss takes over at the end of the season</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Lakers challenged the Suns on the road. After 7 consecutive wins, they lost to the remaining Raptors at home. This is a blow for the Lakers. This game against the Suns should be a good time to adjust the state, solve the problems in the team and the best proof. In addition, Rondo’s return to the game is also a very expected point. The sun team itself is not weak, the strong team harvester, “rob the rich to help the poor” professional, in theory, the Lakers want to win is not easy.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Refuse to lose in a row! 18-for-8, 19 + 7 + 11, Lakers boss takes over at the end of the season/6694c83409ab4d7282d3a4022b26ec36.jpg" alt="Refuse to lose in a row! 18-for-8, 19 + 7 + 11, Lakers boss takes over at the end of the season"><br>At the beginning of the game, the Lakers were very relaxed at both ends of the attack and defense. The first ball gave Booker a break through point shooting tactics easily, and then gave Rubio and Baines the chance to shoot three points in empty space. The defense intensity was too low. But after the warm-up, bushmei closed the cover in the inner line and handed the ball to James. The Lakers quickly set a fast break and hit the Suns every minute. So judging from the performance of the first five minutes, the Lakers started the game slowly, as usual.<br>Rondo came back with about three minutes left in the first quarter, and it was clear that the Lakers’ offense was much better than the first nine games, even smoother than that of James. Because Rondo is a player who organizes games, he will create many tactics and help his teammates to create opportunities. However, the shooting rate of the Lakers is very low, otherwise, Rondo may lead the team against the sun. But it’s also good. Rondo came on for nearly four minutes and sent out four assists. The Lakers and Suns played 26-29 in the first quarter. The outside shooting rate of the Suns game was too high.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Refuse to lose in a row! 18-for-8, 19 + 7 + 11, Lakers boss takes over at the end of the season/9e47756ddbfa4b81999e5e52e5a019dd.jpg" alt="Refuse to lose in a row! 18-for-8, 19 + 7 + 11, Lakers boss takes over at the end of the season"><br>The next quarter, the Lakers and Suns are not very good defense, the two sides started a confrontation, the difference has always been kept within 3 points. The Lakers focus on scoring inside, while the Suns are both inside and outside, with a high percentage of midrange and three-point shots. In terms of momentum, the Suns dominate the Lakers in the first half of the second quarter.<br>In the second half of the second quarter, the Lakers didn’t let Rondo lead the team or Kuzma play, but put on three defenders plus Howard and bushbrow, so the Lakers didn’t play outside and focused on the inside. Howard never showed such a positive performance in the offensive end of the game, playing inside the sun for many times. It’s needless to say, except for Howard’s play, the two Lakers centers ravaged the inner line of the suns. But even so, the Lakers didn’t pull the score apart, because the overall defense of the Lakers was not very good, and the sun’s outside line was very accurate, three-point shot 16 of 8, half-time ended, the two sides played 60-58, the Lakers temporarily led 2 points, half-time sent out 21 assists.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Refuse to lose in a row! 18-for-8, 19 + 7 + 11, Lakers boss takes over at the end of the season/2004542952eb466493c0a1e8eb73461c.jpg" alt="Refuse to lose in a row! 18-for-8, 19 + 7 + 11, Lakers boss takes over at the end of the season"><br>In the third quarter, the Lakers and the Suns started another confrontation, entering a period of alternating lead. The tactics are very simple, but there is no defense on both sides. Compared with the last match of the Raptors, there are several defensive grades.<br>In the first eight minutes of the game, the Lakers played a tactic most of the time: James held the ball and handed it to McGee in half, then Bradley took the ball from the bottom line around the screen of thick eyebrow and McGee played the pick and roll. James and thick eyebrow were directly invisible in the eight minutes, but the sun obviously had targeted defense in the back, and the outside line hit three empty positions in a row Points, but the Lakers’ organizational offense has not changed. In the last four minutes, the Lakers changed their offensive tactics, but the mid and far shots were still not allowed. Bushmei and Kuzma missed two long shots by mistake, but the Suns hit back and killed the inside. The scores of the two sides were very close. The third quarter ended 95-92.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Refuse to lose in a row! 18-for-8, 19 + 7 + 11, Lakers boss takes over at the end of the season/745607e8d73d4709a52deda81eb2478e.jpg" alt="Refuse to lose in a row! 18-for-8, 19 + 7 + 11, Lakers boss takes over at the end of the season"><br>At the end of the game, the defense intensity of the Lakers hasn’t come up yet. The sun’s ball sharing is very good. It’s easier to shoot than the Lakers. It’s not that the Lakers’ defense enthusiasm is not high enough. Generally speaking, there’s no physical strength, no high-level bag, and it’s easy to be burst by the other side. Rubio and Booker cut the Lakers’ defense to pieces.<br>In the last four minutes of the last quarter, Howard was blown continuously on the defensive end, which seemed to affect his mood and judgment. After Vogel replaced him, Kuzma was replaced to play a team with strong mobility. When the Lakers were 2 points behind, James and Kuzma hit three three-point goals in a critical moment, exceeding the difference to 7 points. Looking back, bushbrow effectively interfered with the sun’s attack on the inside and outside for two consecutive times. Finally, the Lakers defeated Taiyang 123-115.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Refuse to lose in a row! 18-for-8, 19 + 7 + 11, Lakers boss takes over at the end of the season/cb26dbf2aa4d4a38ba58a521debceb4f.jpg" alt="Refuse to lose in a row! 18-for-8, 19 + 7 + 11, Lakers boss takes over at the end of the season"><br>In the whole game, James played 37 minutes, 8 of 18 shots, got 19 points, 7 rebounds and 11 assists, with only one mistake, and 1 of 3-point, 4-shot, although the hit rate was very low, he hit a very critical anti super three-point at the critical moment. In the third quarter, James didn’t play much and was suspected of rowing, but in the fourth quarter, especially in the second half, he directly controlled the ball right and raised the busheyebrow. The busheyebrow had no chance to receive the ball at a time. It can be seen that James is very similar to taking the rhythm and ending the game through his own personal ability, the ability to make fouls and play hard. Kuzma played well, 9 out of 16, scored 23 points, especially the last two key three points, which are invaluable. Without his three points, the Lakers would be a little difficult to win.<br>On the Suns side, Booker and Rubio played very well. They got 21 + 9 and 21 + 10 respectively. But at the critical moment, the Suns didn’t have a superstar. Booker obviously wanted to almost mean it. On the Lakers side, there were two superstars. James took over the match alone. This game tells us how important superstars are.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, Minnesota narrowly beat warriors 125-119 overtime at home. The protagonist of the game is undoubtedly Wiggins, who played 44 minutes, 33 shots and 17 shots to get a season high of 40 points, 5 rebounds, 7 assists and 3 covers. Against Russell of the warriors, Russell scored 52 points, 9 rebounds and 5 assists in the whole game. He shot 19 of 37 shots, but he couldn’t get back to the sky.<br>As coach Cole said after the game, the warriors were close to killing the game at the end of the season, and the final victory was sent away by them But Cole praised the young players and they worked very hard.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Roar 40 + 7 to kill the warrior! Wiggins thanked his teammates with tears in his eyes, and Downes gave them a big gift/9f3353b2cc504ad28b401294e1f6483f.jpg" alt="Roar 40 + 7 to kill the warrior! Wiggins thanked his teammates with tears in his eyes, and Downes gave them a big gift"><br>Wiggins did show his talent, and the Timberwolves ushered in transformation. Today in the last minute Warriors also lead 4 points, if in the past the Timberwolves gave up early, and today they have murderous look in the eyes of the whole team. In the last minute, Downes fouled and got two penalties. Covington tried his best to win the ball and Wiggins didn’t hesitate to take it. A slam layup score of 2 points will catch up with the difference.<br>Wiggins has shown terrible tenacity and desperate spirit. What’s our impression of Timberwolves in the past? Although it’s a team full of young talents, Wiggins and Downes are like 40 year old middle-aged people, playing well and carefully. But the new season is really different.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Roar 40 + 7 to kill the warrior! Wiggins thanked his teammates with tears in his eyes, and Downes gave them a big gift/fee18249cf7640b887c39bbb618744ce.jpg" alt="Roar 40 + 7 to kill the warrior! Wiggins thanked his teammates with tears in his eyes, and Downes gave them a big gift"><br>In overtime, Wiggins was full of energy. The start was a mid-range drive against Russell. In addition, okoji, the young iron gate, also showed his heart. At the critical moment, he hit a three-point goal. Then he made six offensive fouls on the defensive end and left the court. In the last season okoggi let James Harden in the offensive side is very helpless, he covered harden disheartened. This year okogi’s defense has improved again.<br>In addition, Wiggins also showed his hegemony in the last two rounds. Russell hit three points, but Wiggins also hit a three-point and he against the wind, showing the boss style. To be honest, if Wiggins had fought like this, the Timberwolves would not have wanted to trade him.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Roar 40 + 7 to kill the warrior! Wiggins thanked his teammates with tears in his eyes, and Downes gave them a big gift/35cc6d119a0d4f90844ac042612b4211.jpg" alt="Roar 40 + 7 to kill the warrior! Wiggins thanked his teammates with tears in his eyes, and Downes gave them a big gift"><br>This summer, Meiji reported that the Timberwolves were interested in Russell, who was still in the net at that time. The Timberwolves wanted to trade Wiggins for Russell, but the nets refused. The Timberwolves reporter revealed that when the nets learned that it was Wiggins as a chip, the deal had not begun and had already ended ahead of time.<br>Russell and Downes are good brothers, so Downes is looking forward to the deal. The result is good luck. Although Wiggins didn’t send him away, it has been proved that retaining Wiggins is good for the forest wolf. Because the league is not dominated by defenders in the era of small ball, with a strong front is the king.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Roar 40 + 7 to kill the warrior!

Wiggins thanked his teammates with tears in his eyes, and Downes gave them a big gift"><br>Wiggins has the potential to become a superstar, especially now it is not healthy, Wiggins is not a dream in the future. After all, Leonard’s draft is still a superstar, and Wiggins is the top pick, young LeBron James, he just needs to cash in his talent.<br>After today’s game, Wiggins also thanked his teammates publicly. He was very excited with tears in his eyes. “Thanks to my teammates for trusting me, trusting me and giving me courage,” Wiggins said. “I feel great now. I’m not the same as I have been for the past few years!”<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Roar 40 + 7 to kill the warrior! Wiggins thanked his teammates with tears in his eyes, and Downes gave them a big gift/2459ee74653244ad9d4e11ef7282257d.jpg" alt="Roar 40 + 7 to kill the warrior! Wiggins thanked his teammates with tears in his eyes, and Downes gave them a big gift"><br>Downes also spoke highly of Wiggins, although today’s Wiggins look more like the eldest of the Timberwolves. But Downes doesn’t care. He wants to see Wiggins like this. “Wiggins is like a hungry beast today,” said Downes. “If he plays like this every game, the opponent will have a headache!”<br>Obviously, Downes is willing to share unlimited selling power with Wiggins, which is the best gift Wiggins received.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>It’s only five months since the end of last season’s finals, and the warriors have been reduced from a top-level power to a bullying role. It’s a pity that the speed of decline is so fast. In addition to the departure and injury of the main players, other teams in the league have been beaten by warriors for several years. Now they catch the chance and try to get angry with the previous players. Think of the warriors before the regular three section punch card, it is out of the mix is always to return.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Russell, 23, has an average of 37 points. Warriors should cultivate him as the core and trade with Curie, 31/9c005b4097124c1782db93052c713486.jpg" alt="Russell, 23, has an average of 37 points. Warriors should cultivate him as the core and trade with Curie, 31"><br>In the first 10 games, the warriors won 2-8, and the opponents of the two games were thunder and the Blazers, and the brothers and sisters of the western team. According to Su Qun’s teacher, except for the three giants, the warriors’ other players are just the level of developing the league. And now that curry and green are injured, it’s really the best thing to do. Of course, in such a dilemma, the warriors still have some flash points, such as two round show Pascal’s performance is very good, 16.4 points per game, the future has the opportunity to replace green as the team’s starting power forward.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Russell, 23, has an average of 37 points. Warriors should cultivate him as the core and trade with Curie, 31/fae4d661b2c343dc8afb0e5726df46ad.jpg" alt="Russell, 23, has an average of 37 points. Warriors should cultivate him as the core and trade with Curie, 31"><br>Russell’s performance is even more promising. After the absence of curry and green, Russell has won 30 points, 52 points and 30 points in three games led by himself, although they are all lost. The average is 37.3 points, which is more exaggerated than Hadden’s. And Russell is very young, only 23 years old, so some fans have sprouted, warriors train Russell as the core, trade away the idea of 31 year old Curie. So is Russell worth it or not?<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Russell, 23, has an average of 37 points. Warriors should cultivate him as the core and trade with Curie, 31/35d21a35fd3f49a98e0b7987674226eb.jpg" alt="Russell, 23, has an average of 37 points. Warriors should cultivate him as the core and trade with Curie, 31"><br>Curie’s condition this season is really relatively low. Before the start of the game, everyone predicted that Curie would have a great chance to get MVP, but he can only get 20 + 5 + 6 data in four games, with a hit rate of only 40%. But it’s just the sequela of the five finals of the warriors. Curie has played too many games in these five years, and his body energy is overdrawn. It’s time to take this opportunity to have a good rest.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Russell, 23, has an average of 37 points. Warriors should cultivate him as the core and trade with Curie, 31/40c749a56aac4f22a9b39592bb78be27.jpg" alt="Russell, 23, has an average of 37 points. Warriors should cultivate him as the core and trade with Curie, 31"><br>And for the warriors, Curie is the soul of the team. He can sacrifice some of his ball rights for the team. Curie’s unsettled three-point ability has derived many efficient tactics for the team. Above all, Curie’s charisma, his charisma and court influence. These are all things that young Russell can’t do for the time being. Even though Russell is really excellent, he is mainly immersed in the mode of individual single combat. The team built around him, and it can’t achieve too much success.<br>Coupled with Curie’s contribution to the team and his huge popularity, the warriors need him to stay until retirement, which is the most correct way. Russell is likely to be trained as a replacement for Curie, or to be traded after he has made his mark this year. It depends on Curie and clay whether Russell can have a better chemical reaction with them after coming back in the future.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Nets away to Denver. Denver’s attack and defense are good. The attack of the nets is good. Owen is the starter and Ding Weidi is the substitute. But other players are not as deep as Denver. Generally speaking, Denver has an absolute advantage in the lineup. If the nets want to win in this game, they must have other players to help Owen and Ding Weidi.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Reverse by nuggets! 34 minutes, 17 + 6 + 9 + 1. At the critical moment, he suddenly dropped the chain/eafa658a88e94cd98bd25293e47cc3bf.jpg" alt="Reverse by nuggets! 34 minutes, 17 + 6 + 9 + 1. At the critical moment, he suddenly dropped the chain"><br>In the first quarter of the game, Owen scored two goals, both of which were shooting against the defense. The offensive end was very simple. Then Owen gave the ball to his teammates to play, but obviously the offensive end was stagnant. After the Denver Nuggets strengthened their defense to Owen, Owen also changed his playing method, taking the series team as the main player to attack and break through the points, so he also demonstrated to his teammates. The whole team began to share the ball, and it was easy for the outside line to have free shooting opportunities.<br>In the rotation time, Ding Weidi leads the team and also plays team attack. On the Nuggets’ side, Jokic refused to attack in the first half of the time, or even didn’t throw in the empty space. In the last few minutes, he made a wild shot, or even shot out of rhythm, holding the ball to catch up with the defensive shot for three points. The Nuggets’ attack had problems, and was suppressed by the nets at the offensive end. In the first quarter, both sides played 35-28, leading the nets by 7 points.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Reverse by nuggets! 34 minutes, 17 + 6 + 9 + 1. At the critical moment, he suddenly dropped the chain/ebedc27c73eb47e080c5f09ee0067c17.jpg" alt="Reverse by nuggets! 34 minutes, 17 + 6 + 9 + 1. At the critical moment, he suddenly dropped the chain"><br>In the second quarter, the net’s three-point shooting rate was very high. They continued the attack mode of sharing the ball in the first quarter. They threw 21 three-point balls in half, most of them were free shots, the ball was running smoothly, Owen didn’t play very independently after he came back to the court, even though Nuggets didn’t contain him, he was also willing to create opportunities for his teammates. In the half of eurotext game, only He scored seven points, but gave eight assists, which shows that Owen put a lot of energy into organizing the attack.<br>Denver Nuggets lost their rebounds in the second quarter. They couldn’t get in on the outside. The biggest difference was more than 16 branches. They could only rely on Millsap in the inside. That’s the disadvantage of the net. The fourth position of the net and Millsap are not of the same level. Denver Nuggets reduced the difference to a single digit by the continuous output of this point. At the end of half-time, the nets and nuggets played 61-49.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Reverse by nuggets! 34 minutes, 17 + 6 + 9 + 1. At the critical moment, he suddenly dropped the chain/a6918cffd03945468811880b4ea9c94b.jpg" alt="Reverse by nuggets! 34 minutes, 17 + 6 + 9 + 1. At the critical moment, he suddenly dropped the chain"><br>In the third quarter of the game, the nets were in trouble for nearly 5 minutes at the offensive end, with more mistakes, lower hit rate and less cooperation. Denver Nuggets relied on the advantage of the inner line, first two three-point shots from the outer line, then more rebounds and make-up in the front court, to minimize the score to 3 points, or Owen’s breakthrough through the middle distance of the cover and Ding Weidi’s single play The basket helps the nets stop bleeding.<br>In the last two and a half minutes, Nuggets shot three points from the outside and made up for the inside, equalizing the score at one stroke. At the end of half-time, the two sides reached 79. In the whole second quarter, the nets only got 18 points. After the hit rate dropped, they could only rely on Owen and Dwight dinwick to play hard. After giving the ball to others, they were not the best choice. The attack would be very stagnant, just like the feeling after Owen scored two goals in the first quarter, no one would attack in series. Denver’s second line-up is mainly through the inner line to play the feel, Millsap and pramley two people protected the basket, hit the front rebounds, the effect is very good.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Reverse by nuggets! 34 minutes, 17 + 6 + 9 + 1. At the critical moment, he suddenly dropped the chain/b122b6a4d4d940f49cc2d64627631b94.jpg" alt="Reverse by nuggets! 34 minutes, 17 + 6 + 9 + 1. At the critical moment, he suddenly dropped the chain"><br>At the end of the game, Owen had a rest off the court. Dwight dinwicky played simply. He had the ball in several rounds, didn’t share the ball, and didn’t score in three minutes. The score was quickly overtaken by nuggets for the first time. Owen came back, the efficiency is not very high, several times in a row did not play under the basket, very demoralizing, Nuggets take advantage of this opportunity to fight back, the difference opened to 9 points. When jokiki came back, the net was changed to Ding Weidi’s attack. He played jokiki twice in a row successfully, but also controlled the difference.<br>In the last three minutes of the last quarter, Denver Nuggets kept the difference at 7 points. The nets missed two three-point shots in a row and missed a very good chance to fight back. Until 46 seconds left in the game, the nets still failed to score three points. The game lost the suspense. At last, both sides played 101-93, and Denver successfully reversed.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Reverse by nuggets! 34 minutes, 17 + 6 + 9 + 1. At the critical moment, he suddenly dropped the chain/e412dd83c1b846c0965425d35146597c.jpg" alt="Reverse by nuggets! 34 minutes, 17 + 6 + 9 + 1. At the critical moment, he suddenly dropped the chain"><br>In the whole game, Nuggets didn’t play well in the first half and were led by the nets by as much as 16 points. In the second half, all three players supported the game and reversed the basketball net. They were Millsap and pramley. The two players had an advantage in the interior. They were the two players in the pursuit of points. The third player was Barton. In the fourth quarter, he hit many key midfielders and held the game. Millsap got 18 + 9, pramley got 10 + 7 + 2, button got 17 + 6 + 4. Jokic got 18 + 10 + 3, rested for a long time, so to speak, he won by lying down.<br>In basketball, Owen played 34 minutes, 8 of 20 shots, 5 of 3-pointers, 1 of 5 shots, 17 points, 6 rebounds, 9 assists, 1 steals, and only 4 points in 2 of 7 shots in the last quarter. In the first half, eight assists were sent out, and only one in the second half. It can be seen how bad the net hit rate in the second half. In the first half of the game, Owen combed the score in an orderly way through his team-mates. But once the three-point goal of his team-mates started to be inaccurate, there was no great significance for Owen to send a wonderful pass. At this time, Owen wanted to stand out and score, but he missed the basket several times in a row. Ding Weidi was also in a hurry. He also played iron in a row. The offensive end of the basketball net started from the middle of the third quarter From the beginning to the end of the game, there were very big problems.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>A focus game ended on the morning of November 18, pelican’s home game against warriors, a direct dialogue between the bottom of the Western league table. This game can never affect the ownership of the bottom of the Western league table, but it can let fans see how far the gap between warriors and the bottom two of the Western league table is! You take your time, fine. 108-100, warriors suffered seven consecutive defeats. Like most fans, I believe that this is not the end but just the beginning.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Seven losing streak! 2 in 10, plus or minus - 15! Cole can't stand it, but you can't help it/fd28565e8f9840f8a73478c45091192c.jpg" alt="Seven losing streak! 2 in 10, plus or minus - 15! Cole can&#39;t stand it, but you can&#39;t help it"><br>From five to six and now to seven, there is always a topic: Drummond green. Some fans told me: you can’t boast about green? At least he hasn’t fallen! But after watching this game, I really can’t find any advantages of green. Even the commentator Wang Zhaofeng is joking: Green has been perfectly integrated into this Warriors team! What did green do today?<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Seven losing streak! 2 in 10, plus or minus - 15! Cole can't stand it, but you can't help it/328a7def9b2247b69930e98c7795f128.jpg" alt="Seven losing streak! 2 in 10, plus or minus - 15! Cole can&#39;t stand it, but you can&#39;t help it"><br>Play 32 minutes, a total of 7 points 6 rebounds 4 assists, plus or minus - 15! Lowest in the audience! The data really doesn’t reflect the value of green. In this game, there are nine warriors who can play. Cole can’t help it! In the signal given ahead, green was placed in the position of starting point guard, while Pascal, after three games, was willing to return to the position of power forward! Cole is not stupid, the fans are not stupid, everyone knows Pascal’s performance in the offensive side, including his help to the team is much bigger than green, but green after all, there is no injury, can not let him go?<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Seven losing streak! 2 in 10, plus or minus - 15! Cole can't stand it, but you can't help it/1f8f51ca834442d6a317b51f7dcebede.jpg" alt="Seven losing streak! 2 in 10, plus or minus - 15! Cole can&#39;t stand it, but you can&#39;t help it"><br>In the first quarter, green played for a few minutes at the point guard position. Cole couldn’t control the rhythm, so he let Berks come to the point guard position, let Pascal go back to the small forward position, and let green play power forward! Green then sent out the first eight minutes of the data is 0 points 1 rebounds 2 assists! In the second quarter, when Pascal, Robinson and others were resting, the warriors really didn’t score points. They had to let green shoot. Green scored a three-point goal in three, got two free throws and got five points, two rebounds and one assists. Even so, the warriors were still under pressure!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Seven losing streak! 2 in 10, plus or minus - 15! Cole can't stand it, but you can't help it/dcab3bbf68db49d986bb331f7c382860.jpg" alt="Seven losing streak! 2 in 10, plus or minus - 15! Cole can&#39;t stand it, but you can&#39;t help it"><br>In the third quarter, green was 20 in 7 minutes, no gains, only got 1 rebounds. Cole was really out of his league. He quickly replaced green, and asked Chris, Bowman, Berks and others to match Pascal. The effect was good. Pascal was a breakthrough and three points. Yong Shi didn’t let the difference continue to expand. And in the fourth quarter, Bowman broke out, helping the warriors to catch up to only 5 points, while green, no contribution in the fourth quarter.<br>How to praise green? There is no performance on the offensive side. The defensive side is facing the pelican’s outside line. He doesn’t go to the top or help his teammates defend. The two brothers Robinson and Pascal are the most tired in this game. They are the most active in defense and dare to make moves on the offensive. Others are sleepwalking.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Seven losing streak! 2 in 10, plus or minus - 15! Cole can't stand it, but you can't help it/fda3d279406b4cc696dcd1659f5242d2.jpg" alt="Seven losing streak! 2 in 10, plus or minus - 15! Cole can&#39;t stand it, but you can&#39;t help it"><br>In the last game, Cole changed and put Pascal and green in the starting line at the same time for the first time, which is to give Greene a signal: someone is better than you, although in the same position, but he deserves to start! Today, Cole asked green to play point guard directly. Green was not good at it. He didn’t get anything back at power forward. Pascal was better at it. Let’s not say that green failed Cole’s trust. At least green is sorry that warriors gave him $18.54 million this year.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Seven losing streak! 2 in 10, plus or minus - 15! Cole can't stand it, but you can't help it/62b2a27b99ab482b98d5fcd8df088f0f.jpg" alt="Seven losing streak! 2 in 10, plus or minus - 15! Cole can&#39;t stand it, but you can&#39;t help it"><br>Of course, Green doesn’t have to worry about the future. He just signed a $100 million contract and his good days are just beginning. Ten thousand steps back to say, even if warriors want to give up him now, is there a team willing to take over? Cole can’t help you!</p>

    <title>Seven times of humiliation and even history! How long can Popovich hold on to the Spurs&#39; disastrous loss to the bottom of the east</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In an NBA regular season that ended on the morning of November 21, the Wizards took the initiative to face the Spurs. The Knicks around the wizards were in a hot state recently. After winning 6 games and 3 victories, they successfully gave up their position at the bottom of the east to the Wizards. The Spurs had suffered 6 consecutive defeats before. In this game, 138-132, the Wizards defeated the Spurs at home, and the Spurs suffered a humiliating 7 consecutive defeats! According to statistics, the Spurs last seven consecutive defeats were from the end of 1997 to the beginning of March, and this seven consecutive defeats have equalled the team’s longest losing record in Duncan era!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Seven times of humiliation and even history! How long can Popovich hold on to the Spurs' disastrous loss to the bottom of the east/5984d5b659d54c768128a7c0f2f690b6.jpg" alt="Seven times of humiliation and even history! How long can Popovich hold on to the Spurs&#39; disastrous loss to the bottom of the east"><br>In terms of data, on the Spurs side, drozan scored 31 points and 4 assists, Adelaide scored 12 points and 10 rebounds, bortel 11 points, Forbes 19 points and 7 assists, mills 16 points and 6 assists. In addition, guy, Murray and belinelli also scored double. For the wizards, eight villages scored 15 points and 7 rebounds, Bryant 11 points and 5 rebounds and 6 assists, Bill 33 points and 4 assists, little Thomas 11 points and 6 assists, beltans 21 points and 5 rebounds. In addition, Wagner and Ismail also scored double.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Seven times of humiliation and even history! How long can Popovich hold on to the Spurs' disastrous loss to the bottom of the east/d34db9d1504f48fe8556ed19edd112d7.jpg" alt="Seven times of humiliation and even history! How long can Popovich hold on to the Spurs&#39; disastrous loss to the bottom of the east"><br>In fact, the two sides were quite glued in the first half, spurs and wizards directly attacked each other, drozan scored in singles, wizards blossomed more points, little Thomas scored three points, Bill slammed the ball, bertans made a breakthrough, and the two sides played 38-35 in a single quarter. In the second quarter, after the Wizards relied on bertans’ anti super score, the Spurs used three-point anti super score continuously under the leadership of mills, and bill also started the scoring mode. The Spurs used three points for a time to pull the difference to 11 points, but Bryant and little Thomas were 6 points behind in half after the climax at the end of the quarter.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Seven times of humiliation and even history! How long can Popovich hold on to the Spurs' disastrous loss to the bottom of the east/84689bc1c94a49a898d2a9aa8f4f18ea.jpg" alt="Seven times of humiliation and even history! How long can Popovich hold on to the Spurs&#39; disastrous loss to the bottom of the east"><br>In the third quarter, drozan and Bill were fighting each other. After Bill scored 7 points in a row, drozan responded 2 + 1. However, the Spurs didn’t expect the wizards to blossom more. With the help of little Thomas and bill, the Wizards beat the Spurs by 3 points at the end of the third quarter! In the fourth quarter, Bill continued to play, and Murray and guy stopped bleeding, then bertans hit 2-3 points in a row to open the difference, including the wizard substitute Smith also hit 2-3 points, although the Spurs once chased the difference to 2 points, but at the last moment drozan missed the free throw, unable to recover the defeat, the score set at 138-132!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Seven times of humiliation and even history! How long can Popovich hold on to the Spurs' disastrous loss to the bottom of the east/e5452b0b0dd04f689bff2c48043b0c3c.jpg" alt="Seven times of humiliation and even history! How long can Popovich hold on to the Spurs&#39; disastrous loss to the bottom of the east"><br>In this game, the most stable offensive and defensive lineup of the Spurs is actually mills, Forbes, guy, Carroll and Adriano. This set of lineup once helped the Spurs to expand the difference to 11 points, but when drozan, Murray, belinelli and others came on the court, the situation was different. Drozan could score, but there was no outside threat. Murray’s pick and roll was too simple. Several times, he and Adriano did the pick and roll After all, it was a simple pass to complete his task, while guy felt very good, but he was embarrassed because he could only play position 3 due to Adelaide’s restriction, but there was drozan in position 3. The Spurs’ team was always wrong. There was no three points in the front line, and the pace was very slow. The internal and external lines lacked connection, while Popovich never changed.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Seven times of humiliation and even history! How long can Popovich hold on to the Spurs' disastrous loss to the bottom of the east/48dd4435cdaa4ef693c7650a36d11e21.jpg" alt="Seven times of humiliation and even history! How long can Popovich hold on to the Spurs&#39; disastrous loss to the bottom of the east"><br>One thing is for sure, Popovich can’t win drozan, and the team is counting on him to score. But if we don’t win Derozan, the Spurs will be monotonous in attack and not strong enough in defense! It’s right to say that drozan is now the leader of the Spurs, but it’s also right to say that drozan is out of line with the Spurs. Of course, the mistake is not entirely in drozan, but it’s not so difficult for the Spurs to have an absolute core in the back line! White’s not here, Murray or mills can’t take on the task.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Seven times of humiliation and even history! How long can Popovich hold on to the Spurs' disastrous loss to the bottom of the east/c9933ec944a44dd1a5ce05f6e9b7e341.jpg" alt="Seven times of humiliation and even history! How long can Popovich hold on to the Spurs&#39; disastrous loss to the bottom of the east"><br>The Spurs, which have lost 7 straight games, are close to the warriors, but this is definitely not the end of the Spurs. The Spurs are still on their road trip. In the next two days, the 76ers will play back-to-back, and then they will return to the home court for three tough battles: the Lakers, the Timberwolves and the Clippers! How long will Popovich and his coaching team last?</p>

    <title>Seventh defeat! The strongest front team collapsed. Barrett turned around and left after the game. Durant was right not to come</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the Knicks lost 102-122 to Detroit. In this game, the pistons missed three tough players, Derek cross, Griffin and Jackson, but the Knicks were still broken by the pistons. The Knicks have played eight games so far this season, with a poor record of 1-7. Now the Knicks are at the bottom of the East, even though they have a lot of strikers this summer. For example, Lakers veteran Randall, and Maurice, who cut the beard from the Spurs. In addition, the Knicks also selected Barrett with a scout.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Seventh defeat! The strongest front team collapsed. Barrett turned around and left after the game. Durant was right not to come/88e49fe702464d6893b5cecbabdd6ba2.jpg" alt="Seventh defeat! The strongest front team collapsed. Barrett turned around and left after the game. Durant was right not to come"><br>But even if the Knicks formed the most terrible front team in the whole league, they gave up the introduction of Durant and Owen to get these fierce generals, it seems that there is no way to save the Knicks. They are still in a rout. Today’s competition really wiped out the last cover cloth of the Knicks.<br>At the beginning of the first quarter, the pistons fell into a fierce attack. Snell scored five points in a row, and then he dunked in a fast break. Drummond also opened the big kill mode under the basket, and big Morris kept hitting long-range shots. The first piston takes the lead by 8 points with 33-25.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Seventh defeat! The strongest front team collapsed. Barrett turned around and left after the game. Durant was right not to come/c1d79b6661434f07903acb86668283ba.jpg" alt="Seventh defeat! The strongest front team collapsed. Barrett turned around and left after the game. Durant was right not to come"><br>In the second quarter, Knicks fought back briefly. They started 6-0. But the pistons didn’t want to be outdone. They also had a 4-0. Morris continued to open the scoring mode, Zhuang Shen also several times under the basket, Galloway and wood also contributed. The pistons were still five points ahead of the Knicks at half-time.<br>In the second half, the two brothers, big Morris and little Morris, started to play against each other, one by one, three points. Then Randall threw in three points and Snell returned three. Zhuang finished the open shot under the basket, and Kennard hit three points again. The third piston has pulled the differential to 11.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Seventh defeat! The strongest front team collapsed. Barrett turned around and left after the game. Durant was right not to come/952a5d472e5d441ea185af461f3002f2.jpg" alt="Seventh defeat! The strongest front team collapsed. Barrett turned around and left after the game. Durant was right not to come"><br>At the end of the day, after all, the suspense has been lost. The piston fire is fully open. Drummond and Kennard are unstoppable. Garowe has completed a 3 + 1. But the Knicks side can only rely on the small Morris and Barrett’s free throws to stabilize. But the difference has been pulled back to more than 20 points, and the game has entered the garbage time.<br>In the whole game, when the pistons were absent from the three main players, Drummond still scored 27 points, 12 boards and 7 assists, Morris 22 points and Snell 24 points.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Seventh defeat! The strongest front team collapsed. Barrett turned around and left after the game. Durant was right not to come/09bc573e063040979607f9c43ca0e9b1.jpg" alt="Seventh defeat! The strongest front team collapsed. Barrett turned around and left after the game. Durant was right not to come"><br>Randall scored 20 points on the Knicks side, Barrett scored 15 points, 8 assists and poor shooting, 4 out of 12. Morris scored 18 points. 20 + 15 + 18 can’t return to the sky and lose 20 points. The Knicks had basically collapsed. After the game, Barrett and Drummond hugged each other and then turned around and left. The young man was lost.<br>From the beginning of the game, Barrett was still full of energy, and now he has become the little prince of melancholy. If time is a pig knife. Then the Knicks is the butcher’s knife for all the players who join the Knicks. As long as they join the Knicks, they start to lose themselves.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Seventh defeat! The strongest front team collapsed. Barrett turned around and left after the game. Durant was right not to come/233ac0335e4841e48d6f60edb5496b7d.jpg" alt="Seventh defeat! The strongest front team collapsed. Barrett turned around and left after the game. Durant was right not to come"><br>How passionate was Randall at Pelican last season? All kinds of fighting, but now also lost the desire to win in the past. And little Morris was a tough guy when he was at Celtic, hungry for victory. But now? Little Morris was also influenced by the Knicks and became unable to play.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Seventh defeat! The strongest front team collapsed. Barrett turned around and left after the game. Durant was right not to come/a3113e0a485241b7a6e02c793d8ff47e.jpg" alt="Seventh defeat! The strongest front team collapsed. Barrett turned around and left after the game. Durant was right not to come"><br>Can only say that little Morris gave up spurs and joined Knicks, treachery now regret it? Is such a bad team really comfortable? Durant and Owen were right not to come to the Knicks. It’s really poisonous here. Nobody can save it.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Los Angeles Lakers have won 7 consecutive games in the new season, and now they occupy the first place in the West. The combination of LeBron James and Davis is also a tacit cooperation, the two players’ style is not conflict and seamless connection. These two people’s existence promoted the Lakers’ attack and defense level to another level. Combined with the internal and external defense of Bradley + Green + Howard, the Lakers have basically killed their opponents by defense in the past few games. No matter how many points are behind, the Lakers can complete the reversal.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Superman Season Three! Howard is interested in dunk contest, talking about James Showdown I waited for 30 years/3a75f611f5e94ad0872c2fb0e5372d3c.jpg" alt="Superman Season Three! Howard is interested in dunk contest, talking about James Showdown I waited for 30 years"><br>Howard has set the first record in the nba new season in the past six games, scoring 42 points in 21 of 24 shots, with a 2-point shooting rate of more than 90%. This is the highest hit rate in the league. It has to be said that Howard is really back to the top. In the pre-season, we can see that Howard’s condition has not been improved to the best. He didn’t move fast enough to bounce back.<br>But Howard changed in the regular season and started to improve. Now, he has become the No. 5 gate of the Lakers, with one hand grabbing the protective frame and rebounds. And moving faster, not only can the top defense of the interior line, but also can defend the small guard, a base salary beast is really fragrant.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Superman Season Three! Howard is interested in dunk contest, talking about James Showdown I waited for 30 years/3afd2444d345421ca441820d1ea2f775.jpg" alt="Superman Season Three! Howard is interested in dunk contest, talking about James Showdown I waited for 30 years"><br>So how good is Howard now? Today, Howard announced a decision that he intends to participate in the 20-year All-Star dunk competition and stage Superman’s return to the third season. Howard thinks he didn’t have the confidence to take part in the slam dunk contest before because he didn’t jump enough. Now Howard thinks he has recovered.<br>“I won the slam dunk contest 11 years ago with a Superman fly buckle, and you’ve been asking me if I’m going to take part in the slam dunk contest,” Howard said. I was hesitant because I lost my bounce. Now I’m thinking about joining because I’m in good shape and my legs are all right. But now my focus is still on the championship. I have almost all my personal honors, that is, there is no championship ring * *. “<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Superman Season Three!

Howard is interested in dunk contest, talking about James Showdown I waited for 30 years"><br>Howard has been in the magic for a long time, dominating the league’s best defensive player. It’s the magic guard under the basket. It can be said that Howard alone supports the magic defense system. And the stronger Howard gets in the playoffs, the one star four shot system that year made Howard reach the finals.<br>This is due to Howard’s strong personal ability. Although he has now declined, the skinny camel is bigger than the horse. Howard has the sense of defense and moving position. It’s not McGee’s match. Although Howard’s bounce ability is not as good as McGee’s now, McGee’s consciousness is just a few roads short of Warcraft<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Superman Season Three!

Howard is interested in dunk contest, talking about James Showdown I waited for 30 years"><br>In addition, Howard talked about working with LeBron James. In the East, Howard and James were enemies. Both of them had the strongest body on the planet. Howard is very excited about working with James, because in the past he could not imagine playing with James, which is too unrealistic.<br>Because James is so strong, if they cooperate in the league in the past, it will end. Now Howard gets the base salary, James gets the top salary. That led to the two joining forces, and Howard sent James a request to invite him to the taco party next Tuesday.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Superman Season Three!

Howard is interested in dunk contest, talking about James Showdown I waited for 30 years"><br>“Once James invited me to his taco party, I’ll take it,” Howard said Howard also wrote a sentence on his social media to thank the Lakers for taking care of him.<br>“I’ve played basketball for 30 years, and I’ve never felt so much joy as I do now,” Howard wrote! The pursuit of the summit is the source of my strength and happiness! Let’s keep going, guys</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>After the last defeat of raptors, today the king finally stepped out of the gloom and faced the eagle, who is known as the eastern warrior. In the face of little curitreiyan, the king did not show mercy. They played the quicksilver like attack, and the king scored 18 three-point shots, beating the hawks with a three-point shooting rate of 60%. The score was 121-109.<br>King in the beginning of five consecutive defeats, the last four games 3-1 loss, only lost to the Raptors. It looks like the king is back to normal. They are 3-6 and are heading for the top eight in the West. Walton, who suffered a brief defeat, is now beginning to cash in on his talent, putting the average into the king’s heart.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/The big four scored 75 points to win the third game of the season.

After Walton&#39;s showdown, the 73 win miracle is coming"><br>As you can see from the scores of the king’s four giants, Walton is building the king into the next warrior. Fox scored 17 points and 9 assists, Hilde 22 points, Bogdanovic 20 points and Barnes 16 points. Four people cut 75 points. The king plays real team basketball. As Walton said, when players experience the new system, the new coach will have pains, but the adaptation can be better.<br>Today’s game is also true. From the first quarter, the king showed his attacking power. When he came up, he was very hot. After that, Hilde started the attack mode and scored 4 points in a row. The eagles are totally dependent on Trey young, with the king leading 7 points 31-24 in the first quarter.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/The big four scored 75 points to win the third game of the season.

After Walton&#39;s showdown, the 73 win miracle is coming"><br>In the second section, both sides fell into strangulation, but there was no doubt that the king had more firepower. Barnes scored points in a row, Foxley shot out, and Bogdanovic was a three-point shooter. The king made a 21-3 attack. In one stroke, the difference was widened to 21 points, and all kinds of King’s conducting balls were very smooth. That’s what Walton looked like when he led the warriors. Now the king also called out, but the eagle didn’t want to be mentioned by the king to punch out.<br>Parker and Trey young started their own attack mode again, and the hawks were only 16 points short of 21 in the half. In the second half, the Hawks finally woke up. Trevor Young made two consecutive pitches and Parker also hit a three-point shot. The Hawks started to catch up to six points. But it was Bogdanovic who came out at the critical moment, hitting three points to keep the king eight points ahead at the end of the three quarters.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/The big four scored 75 points to win the third game of the season.

After Walton&#39;s showdown, the 73 win miracle is coming"><br>At the end of the game, the eagles launched three attacks, and Xu Erte kept scoring points, while redish also hit three points. At one point, the eagle had the worst difference. But Bogdanovic broke out again, scoring three points with Joseph and Ariza. The eagle managed to score 1 point, and was immediately pulled back to 18 points. Trejan can’t stop the king’s attack even though he throws again.<br>For the eagles, Trey young did his best. He scored 30 points, 12 assists and shot 22 of 12, while Parker scored 25 points, 8 rebounds.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/The big four scored 75 points to win the third game of the season.

After Walton&#39;s showdown, the 73 win miracle is coming"><br>The best substitute for king is undoubtedly pogdanovic. He went out for 29 minutes. He got 20 points, 4 rebounds, 5 assists, 1 snatch and 1 cover in 6 of 9 shots, including 5 of 6 three pointers and 3 free throws.<br>In addition, Ariza, who used to be very depressed, began to wake up recently. Ariza scored 14 points and 2 boards in 5 of 7 in the whole game, and shot well in the last quarter. It’s worth mentioning that at the end of the game, when the garbage time came, the camera caught Walton’s face and he was smiling.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/The big four scored 75 points to win the third game of the season.

After Walton&#39;s showdown, the 73 win miracle is coming"><br>Now Walton really has a sense of relief, the king won the third, he can let go. Maybe the 73 - win Walton is coming back and there’s hope for the kings playoffs. Walton praised the unity of the team after the game.</p>

    <title>The devil wants MVP Leonard talked about Shaw&#39;s showdown and made a promise for the Clippers</title>
    <url>/2019/11/10/The%20devil%20wants%20MVP%20Leonard%20talked%20about%20Shaw&#39;s%20showdown%20and%20made%20a%20promise%20for%20the%20Clippers/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Clippers beat the Blazers 107-101 in a regular season game that ended today. In this game, the clipper star kehuai Leonard came back. Leonard played 33 minutes, scoring 27 points, 13 rebounds and 4 assists. In the first three quarters, Leonard only got 9 points, but in the last quarter, he scored 18 points and 6 leads the team to complete the reversal, it has to be said that Leonard’s key ball this year is still hard. Even braver than when he was at Raptors last season, when Leonard was not injured well. Although he still hasn’t fully recovered to the peak of Spurs this year, Leonard really practiced his skills to the best of his ability.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/The devil wants MVP Leonard talked about Shaw's showdown and made a promise for the Clippers/b5b9c10995f9402ba087de6347d7e72f.jpg" alt="The devil wants MVP Leonard talked about Shaw&#39;s showdown and made a promise for the Clippers"><br>In addition, the clippers have a magnificent record and a strong team. Today, the combination of Luwei and Harrell scored 41 points again. Zubates and shamet also played their part. When Paul George comes back, the quality of attack and defense will continue to improve. Because what George promoted was the first fire power of the clipper, the main force of the clipper was still a little weak at the start of the race, and he totally relied on the substitutes to contribute points. With George, the clipper could sail.<br>In addition, some fans suggested Leonard to fight for the MVP of this season, but at present, Leonard is not interested in it. He never put the honor of MVP in his backpack.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/The devil wants MVP Leonard talked about Shaw's showdown and made a promise for the Clippers/d0bc815ef44945c69b81a532d8af69df.jpg" alt="The devil wants MVP Leonard talked about Shaw&#39;s showdown and made a promise for the Clippers"><br>After today’s game, the reporter asked Leonard: “kowai, will you start targeting this season’s MVP?”<br>Leonard shook his head and said: “I can tell you, regular season MVP is never one of my goals, no matter which team I am on, I have no such idea. Because my goal is to win the championship, which is what I always focus on * *. “<br>Obviously, Leonard made a great decision to help the Clippers win the championship, which is Leonard’s commitment to the Clippers. Just as Leonard won the title at the Raptors last season, he made a promise, and Leonard is a player who will do anything to win the title.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/The devil wants MVP Leonard talked about Shaw's showdown and made a promise for the Clippers/fc58eef3626b4726b550f2b0f91168c2.jpg" alt="The devil wants MVP Leonard talked about Shaw&#39;s showdown and made a promise for the Clippers"><br>Leonard has learned how to keep fit in the regular season since last season in order not to lose the chain like some superstars in the playoffs. For example, he was absent from the game with bucks and chose to take a back-to-back rotation. It also fined the Clippers $50000 by the league. We all know that Xiao Hua, the president of the league, has been boycotting the rotation, especially that Leonard was absent from the battle with alphanumeric brother, which made Xiao Hua a little dissatisfied.<br>The reason why the union fined the Clippers was simply that old rivers thought Leonard was healthy but took turns. And what he said after today’s game was that he was injured, just not too much. The team doctor also advised him not to play, which was Leonard’s message.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/The devil wants MVP Leonard talked about Shaw's showdown and made a promise for the Clippers/bc7e12f4817c4a95a18bcbf468f058cd.jpg" alt="The devil wants MVP Leonard talked about Shaw&#39;s showdown and made a promise for the Clippers"><br>What the Clippers meant was clear, too, that they respected Leonard’s privacy. I don’t want to disclose the details of his injury, so I can only use Leonard’s health to answer the questions of the reporters. In the end, Shaw fined the clipper, which disappointed Leonard. When it comes to fines for his healthy team after the game, Leonard also made a request to the league. Please respect the player’s privacy and take good care of the player.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/The devil wants MVP Leonard talked about Shaw's showdown and made a promise for the Clippers/29641cd55a2f46409e1714a472e86aba.jpg" alt="The devil wants MVP Leonard talked about Shaw&#39;s showdown and made a promise for the Clippers"><br>Leonard said: “I support my coach rivers because I am a clipper player. And the penalty is disappointing, which makes it feel like the league wants players to play, whether they’re ready or injured. For me, I will not be affected, I will only do things to keep me healthy and make the team successful, but I don’t care<br>It’s obvious that he will continue to take turns in the future. Xiao Hua should listen to his advice and keep his privacy, rather than continue to attack the Clippers in the future.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Raptors challenge clippers away. This is a back-to-back game of raptors. In the last game, the Lakers, Lori and Ibaka were absent from the game. SICAM just made 9-for-25 in the second half of the game to recover the score and expand to a double-digit lead. James started late and had a low success rate, which ended the Lakers’ winning streak. In the case of extreme fatigue and the absence of the main force, in theory, it is difficult for the Raptors to take two consecutive wins away from staples.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/The offensive end is almost locked! 34 points, 12 + 11 + 9 + 3 + 9 + 12.

The Raptors are very uncomfortable"><br>In the first quarter, the clipper made a better attack and defense conversion, and Patterson hit two three-point shots at the bottom corner and the top of the arc to help the clipper build up its advantage. Raptors had a low starting percentage and made a lot of mistakes. They only got 2 points in 4 minutes. Then the two sides entered the iron playing mode. Raptors began to defend Leonard. The attack efficiency of the Clippers began to decline. Paterson and Leonard both dropped three points in a row. After Harrell came back, he didn’t play the hand feeling. It was still the pressure of Luwei to stand out in the continuous scoring link. However, although the main force of the Raptors, but the substitute players have made four consecutive three-point shots, in the first quarter of the game to rewrite the score into 23-15, leading 8 points in a single quarter.<br>In the next quarter, Leonard led Harrell and Ludwig to play Raptors with three shots. Although Leonard himself didn’t score, he attracted the defense. After several waves of operation, Ludwig and Harrell leveled the score.<br>In the last three minutes, zubates played a dominant performance at both ends of attack and defense. He made two consecutive hook and freehand shots under the basket at the attack end, blocked Gasol’s throw at the defense end, and interfered with the guards who helped the defense break in. The Clippers built up a slight advantage on defense. At the end of half-time, the two sides played 46-51, with the Clippers leading by 5 points.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/The offensive end is almost locked! 34 points, 12 + 11 + 9 + 3 + 9 + 12.

The Raptors are very uncomfortable"><br>In the third quarter of the game, Leonard returned to the court, but was defended by the Raptors. In a rebounding round, the four men of the Raptors directly chased him out of the three-point line. Leonard spent nine cows and two tigers to pass the ball to the empty teammates at the bottom corner, but did not score. After that, the Raptors made a wave of defense and consumption to the Clippers through many times of high-intensity physical confrontation and aggressive fighting, and the momentum was obviously inclined to the Raptors. The third quarter played five minutes, Leonard still did not hit the shot, 5 free throws 5 out of 5 points.<br>Although the clipper was on the way to deal with the ball, the Raptors still used to bag Leonard. As long as Leonard held the ball close to the three-point line, fanfulit and sICAM went forward to attack, instead of forcing Leonard to pass the ball, while Beverly and shamet’s three-point ball was not enough and missed a lot of empty opportunities. Three quarters later, the two sides played 73-78, Leonard scored only one goal.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/The offensive end is almost locked! 34 points, 12 + 11 + 9 + 3 + 9 + 12.

The Raptors are very uncomfortable"><br>At the end of the game, the Clippers strengthened their defense against the basket. Van fleet got two blocks in a row. Sikam was also covered once. Dewey got a high-intensity grip on the ball, but he didn’t make a strong shot. Instead, he created opportunities for his teammates by breaking through and attracting the defense. The Clippers hit a wave of 9-1 small climax at the beginning of the game, exceeding the difference to 3 points.<br>Although the Raptors performed well at the defensive end and locked Leonard and Luwei, they had no strength to score at the offensive end. Especially at the end of the fourth quarter, the shooting rate of the Raptors dropped sharply, and they could only score through fast attack and defense conversion. In the half-time positional battle, they could hardly score, and had been suppressed by the Clippers. With van fleet’s last three-point throw away, the Raptors had no chance at all. The two sides played 88-98 and the Raptors lost 10 points.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/The offensive end is almost locked! 34 points, 12 + 11 + 9 + 3 + 9 + 12.

The Raptors are very uncomfortable"><br>In the whole game, Leonard played 34 minutes, only 2 of 11 shots, 4 of 3-pointers, 0 of 4 shots, 12 points, 11 rebounds, 9 assists, 3 steals, 9 mistakes, plus or minus 12. It’s rare to see Leonard hit such a percentage. In the whole game, only 11 shots were made, and 9 mistakes were sent out. From the data alone, we can see how good the Raptors’ targeted defense effect is.<br>Cicham played another 43 minutes in this game, and he played 42 minutes in the last back-to-back game against the Lakers. At the end of this game, he didn’t become the Savior, and he really didn’t have more strength to put on the offensive end. Not only because the Lakers consumed a lot of money for him, but also because the Clippers defended cicham very well in this game. In the whole game, he shot 6 out of 17, 1 out of 3:6 16 points 10 rebounds 6 assists 1 block.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/The offensive end is almost locked! 34 points, 12 + 11 + 9 + 3 + 9 + 12.

The Raptors are very uncomfortable"><br>Although the Raptors lost, but they played a very wonderful game, saw that they should have the competitiveness as a strong Eastern team, in the absence of two main players can still play with the clippers, the Lakers play like this, try to ask which other team in the league can do it?</p>

    <title>The west is in a mess! Strong team beat black horse! Wiggins, your boss&#39;s position is not guaranteed</title>

Wiggins, your boss's position is not guaranteed/98350547ed46407994c602cf11bba7b6.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! Strong team beat black horse! Wiggins, your boss&#39;s position is not guaranteed"><br>Beijing is an NBA regular season game that ended at noon on November 19. Jazz played Timberwolves at home. Both teams are the top eight teams in the West. Jazz ranked fourth in the west before, and they killed to dig gold. Timberwolves lost two games in a row in Wiggins’ absence. In this competition, Wiggins continued to suspend due to illness after dealing with the death of his grandmother 102-112, jazz home defeat Minnesota! In the future, anyone who says that a star has unlimited shooting power can get 40 points. I believe Mitchell is the first one to stand up against it: I can’t!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/The west is in a mess! Strong team beat black horse! Wiggins, your boss's position is not guaranteed/d94620a4b1a84f99a387aa46fd907edd.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! Strong team beat black horse! Wiggins, your boss&#39;s position is not guaranteed"><br>In terms of data, Covington scored 15 points and 8 rebounds, Downes scored 29 points and 13 rebounds and 5 assists, tiger scored 21 points and 11 assists, and both Oakey and Martin scored double. On the Jazz side, bergdan scored 18 points and 6 rebounds, gobel 16 points and 14 rebounds, Mitchell, 5 of 23, 17 points and 7 rebounds in total, Conley 15 + 6, Ingalls and green scored double. It’s not polite to say that Mitchell would give his teammates even a few shots less, no matter who his teammates are and let them give them more shots, the Jazz can’t lose, just so directly.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/The west is in a mess! Strong team beat black horse! Wiggins, your boss's position is not guaranteed/aefaf371a98548c59fbebe90a3dc7b97.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! Strong team beat black horse! Wiggins, your boss&#39;s position is not guaranteed"><br>At the beginning of the fight, Lehmann and Covington gave the Timberwolves a three-point lead. Then Conley and bergdan opened their hands. Gobel took whatever he wanted in the penalty area. The Timberwolves relied on the three-point goals of TIG, oakgee and Downes to respond continuously. The Timberwolves led the Jazz 36-32 in the single quarter. In the second quarter, Ingles broke the scoring gap, but the Timberwolves still had a three-point response. At this time, Mitchell began to play iron, and the Timberwolves took advantage of it to open the difference. After Mitchell came off, O’Neill and Ingles scored three points in a row to equalize the difference. At the end of half-time, the Timberwolves were three points ahead of jazz.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/The west is in a mess! Strong team beat black horse!

Wiggins, your boss&#39;s position is not guaranteed"><br>In the third quarter, Downes led the team to a climax, while O’Neill and Bogdan hit three-point response in a row. After that, Gerber and Conley helped the jazz to take the lead. Mitchell came again, lay up and hit the iron, hit the iron in the middle of the pitch, and finally hit a three-point ball. The jazz was 2 points ahead of the Timberwolves. In the fourth quarter, the Jazz got 6 points from Mitchell and Greenlane, and then Downes turned into Tracy McGrady. He scored three points in a row. Martin added the icing on the cake. After the 18-2 climax, Conley responded with 5 points, but not enough. Finally, the Timberwolves defeated the Jazz 112-102 away, and the Jazz lost at home for the first time in the new season!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/The west is in a mess!

Wiggins, your boss&#39;s position is not guaranteed"><br>Let’s talk about jazz first. Before the game, 8-4, unbeaten at home. After bergdan and Conley gradually adapted to the team’s rhythm, Mitchell began to ask for more shooting power, but his hit rate was really not high. Many times, jazz relied on excellent overall defense to win the game. Today, it was magnified infinitely. After Tang’s three-way break-up, jazz failed to In response, Mitchell was stubborn. Of course, the Jazz’s future schedule is relatively easy. There will be a Timberwolves game away from home, and then they will return home to face the warriors and pelicans in a row. I believe that the warriors are doomed.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/The west is in a mess! Strong team beat black horse! Wiggins, your boss's position is not guaranteed/7cfdbec99e7f4b5fb5edf52ae551520c.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! Strong team beat black horse! Wiggins, your boss&#39;s position is not guaranteed"><br>On the other hand, for the third game in which Wiggins was absent, Downes said that the team needed more people to stand up in the absence of Wiggins after losing to a certain team in the last game. Today, Downes came out first. He scored 7-3 points in the whole game. He beat you. Gobel didn’t dare to defend himself. He went crazy and scored 3 points on the outside line. And tiger also excelled in his task, leading the substitute to hold the score tightly in the connecting section. Wiggins needs to return in time. I’m afraid that if he doesn’t come back again, he will not be able to establish his leading position in the first nine games! Of course, Mitchell did a lot of good.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/The west is in a mess! Strong team beat black horse! Wiggins, your boss's position is not guaranteed/68309da710554da68eebf9b8454268f0.jpg" alt="The west is in a mess! Strong team beat black horse! Wiggins, your boss&#39;s position is not guaranteed"><br>After this war, the west is in a mess! The Timberwolves further narrowed the gap with the front teams. After the Jazz lost the game, they were thrown away by the Lakers nuggets and other three teams. From the jazz to the Timberwolves, including the lone Rangers, the suns and the clippers, the gap between the five teams was within one win! The brutal fighting in the West started in November!</p>

    <title>The west is too complicated! The Lakers are threatened, five teams are in a huddle, six teams are in a big fight, and the warriors are out of contention</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>At noon on November 19, today, nine NBA regular season games are all over, and the ranking of the western region has changed a lot. The whole western region has been divided into four levels, of course, warriors are the only one. Take a brief look at the competition. Knicks home 123-105 defeat knights, Knicks since fighting warriors at the bottom of the west, they began to wake up, 6-3 win, successfully bid farewell to the bottom of the east at the same time seems to be like a warrior demonstration: we are not the same! Nets home 86-115 fiasco Pacers, fiasco is not terrible, who is missing the boss, Owen, hurry to come back.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/The west is too complicated! The Lakers are threatened, five teams are in a huddle, six teams are in a big fight, and the warriors are out of contention/707cda4c96874763b52a204021ad1ff4.jpg" alt="The west is too complicated! The Lakers are threatened, five teams are in a huddle, six teams are in a big fight, and the warriors are out of contention"><br>Raptors’ 132-96 victory over Hornets is the eighth in the East. Your Raptors are not well staffed recently. Team leader Lori is still recovering. As for blood washing Hornets? The third quarter didn’t finish the match, but the fourth quarter came up to hold the hornet’s bench. It’s another beating. It’s too brutal. Raptors are not weak! Mosaic home 132-108 defeated the Blazers, eight consecutive wins, Anthony has not yet played, nothing to sum up. Lone ranger defeated the Spurs 117-110, and the Spurs suffered six consecutive humiliations! Dongqiqi is 42 + 12 + 11, under 21 years old, breaking many records of Lao Zhan, which is terrible.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/The west is too complicated! The Lakers are threatened, five teams are in a huddle, six teams are in a big fight, and the warriors are out of contention/8fe718be1b5d4446aef3bba550416438.jpg" alt="The west is too complicated! The Lakers are threatened, five teams are in a huddle, six teams are in a big fight, and the warriors are out of contention"><br>Sun home 85-99 defeat Celtic, Rubio back spasm, this game can’t play, then the sun can’t hold, the first half can still bite the score, the second half suddenly collapsed, understandable, tomorrow the sun back-to-back play king, this game strategic give up, let Rubio more rest. Timberwolves beat jazz 112-102 away from home, which was not a small surprise. Mitchell of jazz returned to iron King’s nature. In 5 of 23, it’s not polite to say that Mitchell would give three less shots to his teammates, no matter who he gave them! Jazz don’t have to lose! In the absence of Wiggins, Downes scored 7-3 points. When he was a father and a mother, he wanted to rob Wiggins’s boss!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/The west is too complicated! The Lakers are threatened, five teams are in a huddle, six teams are in a big fight, and the warriors are out of contention/6449af43297d4550a72154f8fd71c07c.jpg" alt="The west is too complicated! The Lakers are threatened, five teams are in a huddle, six teams are in a big fight, and the warriors are out of contention"><br>The clipper narrowly beat thunder 90-88, the pickled peppers state is really average, 18 points and 7 mistakes, but the last three points are wonderful. Of course, the clipper can win the ball, thanks to Harrell and Luwei, these two brothers feed me one in the fourth quarter, openly show their love, making Paul like a thorn in his throat. In addition, Leonard’s third consecutive truce game, I don’t know when he will return, but Leonard is very smart, he chose a team that doesn’t need to worry about the regular season results. Playoffs, get out of my way!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/The west is too complicated! The Lakers are threatened, five teams are in a huddle, six teams are in a big fight, and the warriors are out of contention/2bae1fb08a174a9bac64c3c7b41322d9.jpg" alt="The west is too complicated! The Lakers are threatened, five teams are in a huddle, six teams are in a big fight, and the warriors are out of contention"><br>After the game, the 15 teams in the West were divided into four positions, the Lakers, XXX and nuggets top three, and the Lakers still can’t leave the second place, they have won eight games in a row! Although the Nuggets are not so outstanding, they win on a stable basis. These three teams are likely to be the main players in the West’s top competition in the coming months.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/The west is too complicated! The Lakers are threatened, five teams are in a huddle, six teams are in a big fight, and the warriors are out of contention/31b16116656b4c0aa5e8008db5c32b29.jpg" alt="The west is too complicated! The Lakers are threatened, five teams are in a huddle, six teams are in a big fight, and the warriors are out of contention"><br>Starting from the clipper, lone ranger, jazz, sun, forest wolf, 4-8 places, each other’s difference is no more than a winning field, a file! The Timberwolves and the sun are still the black horses, while the lone Rangers rely on dongqiqi and Boshen to rise successfully this season. The Jazz are old-fashioned strong teams. Besides, Conley and Bogdan are getting better as long as Mitchell doesn’t get dizzy. Clippers, they’re trying to keep their strength.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/The west is too complicated! The Lakers are threatened, five teams are in a huddle, six teams are in a big fight, and the warriors are out of contention/915bff912b9f4063965d72c0ef9d584e.jpg" alt="The west is too complicated! The Lakers are threatened, five teams are in a huddle, six teams are in a big fight, and the warriors are out of contention"><br>Starting from the ninth place king, grizzlies, thunder, blazers, spurs and pelicans are at most 1.5 games away from each other. Grizzlies and thunder are really weak, but they also didn’t give up. The king lost 5 times in the opening game, and pelicans are trapped in Zion, Yingge, Qiuge and other frequent injuries. Spurs and blazers join in the fun. To be honest, the ranking of these two teams shouldn’t be so Low.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/The west is too complicated! The Lakers are threatened, five teams are in a huddle, six teams are in a big fight, and the warriors are out of contention/7cdaf5f31831476690d82d231043decd.jpg" alt="The west is too complicated! The Lakers are threatened, five teams are in a huddle, six teams are in a big fight, and the warriors are out of contention"><br>The warriors are the only player in the league. They are all invincible. In the future, the warriors will go on a continuous road trip. Grizzlies, lone Rangers, jazz, thunder, bulls and other teams will play to see if there are any unlucky guys who can make the warriors win. The last unlucky guy never got up since he lost to the warrior. He is called the pioneer.</p>

    <title>The western pattern is complex! The Lakers are worried when they reach the top. They are polarized. Warriors start the devil&#39;s game</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>On November 18, there are fewer NBA games today, and most of the games are one-sided. However, there are still some surprises. Take a look at the game. 76 away 114-95 victory over Cavaliers, three flower, Harris state hot. Celtic 99-100 lose king, Holmes free throw, Celtic end ten consecutive wins, the journey to the west is a bit difficult! Magic home 125-121 to beat the wizards, Nuggets 131-114 to beat the Grizzlies, Murray scored 39 points.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/The western pattern is complex! The Lakers are worried when they reach the top. They are polarized. Warriors start the devil's game/06a4cc96c59d472daa2015542a6d16fa.jpg" alt="The western pattern is complex! The Lakers are worried when they reach the top. They are polarized. Warriors start the devil&#39;s game"><br>Warriors 100-108 away defeat pelican, green 10 in 2, plus and minus the team’s lowest, the key is Cole can not take him! The Lakers easily beat the Hawks 122-101 at home. With Jen getting the Lakers’ first point with pop layup, the game lost its suspense and the Hawks didn’t want to resist.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/The western pattern is complex! The Lakers are worried when they reach the top. They are polarized. Warriors start the devil's game/73ecb1803a244ef39c5ed8270f2ca555.jpg" alt="The western pattern is complex! The Lakers are worried when they reach the top. They are polarized. Warriors start the devil&#39;s game"><br>In the latest ranking of the Western Conference, the Lakers are 11-2, Denver 9-3, and jazz behind them, although they lost 1 point in the last game, have been struggling in recent times, 7-3. Of course, the two biggest black horse suns and forest wolves in the West are still in the top eight, and the lone ranger ranks seventh. In fact, the gap between the top eight in the west is not very big, and the Lakers continue to refresh the best opening record in the last 10 years. The biggest change of the game against the eagles comes from the three points of the outside line. It is important to know that the Lakers are the last five in the league in terms of the three-point ball hit number and hit rate. Thanks to the internal scoring and defense efficiency, the Lakers rank first in the league.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/The western pattern is complex! The Lakers are worried when they reach the top. They are polarized. Warriors start the devil's game/601fc4b17762439ea36d7e417e0f3e6c.jpg" alt="The western pattern is complex! The Lakers are worried when they reach the top. They are polarized. Warriors start the devil&#39;s game"><br>But the test of the Lakers has just begun. Two days later, after playing thunder at home, the Lakers will start a journey to the West. They will play thunder, grizzlies, spurs and pelicans one after another. Then, after playing wizards and lone Rangers at home, they will have another trip away. The Nuggets are back-to-back, and the developers are waiting for them. At present, the Lakers’ home record is 7-1 and away record is 4-1. To be honest, in the 11 games the Lakers won, there is a lack of quality games. Winning the jazz, the heat and the Suns are not many hard battles. Next, the Lakers need to be cautious. Regular season is to find deficiencies, improve shortcomings, and meet the playoffs with a healthy team. Don’t be so happy. After all, the Lakers are not just aiming for the playoffs.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/The western pattern is complex! The Lakers are worried when they reach the top. They are polarized. Warriors start the devil's game/1381890085ff49b0aef20d2378e4a87b.jpg" alt="The western pattern is complex! The Lakers are worried when they reach the top. They are polarized. Warriors start the devil&#39;s game"><br>In the eighth place, the king, thunder, grizzlies, blazers, spurs and pelicans, six teams, became the second tier. There is no irony here. That is to say, today’s fight between the warriors and pelicans is also seen. It’s all a remnant. Only Pascal can deserve respect and applause. Of course, these teams also have different situations. King’s start is too bad, a wave of five consecutive defeats hurt his vitality. In the last seven games, he has won five games, with an obvious upward momentum. Thunder under Paul’s leadership, some games seem unreasonable, but can win, such as defeat 76 people. Grizzlies play every game seriously and show their strength. Spurs and blazers, the state is really not good, especially spurs, drozan some too eager to achieve, want bright data, want a top salary, and this spurs is not fit.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/The western pattern is complex! The Lakers are worried when they reach the top. They are polarized. Warriors start the devil's game/c72cab08962d4527a98fa1175075397f.jpg" alt="The western pattern is complex! The Lakers are worried when they reach the top. They are polarized. Warriors start the devil&#39;s game"><br>The warrior is the only one, no one can get out of his right. Seven consecutive defeats set a record for the worst consecutive defeat of the warriors in Cole’s era, but this must not be the lowest point of the warriors! The devil’s schedule of warriors is about to start. From the day after tomorrow, play Grizzlies and lone Rangers back-to-back, follow the visiting Jazz closely, and return to the main floor to face thunder and bulls. After that, the cruel journey to the East will start again: heat, magic Eagle back-to-back, Hornets, Bulls! Until December 12, warriors play Knicks at home, until Russell comes back, Rooney comes back, it is possible to win, and before that, there are 11 games! I hope Cole can keep his warrior position. This winter, San Francisco is very cold!</p>

    <title>Three points, six boards and two blocks, Howard tells Anthony with action if you want to stay in the NBA, attitude decides everything</title>
    <url>/2019/11/23/Three%20points,%20six%20boards%20and%20two%20blocks,%20Howard%20tells%20Anthony%20with%20action%20if%20you%20want%20to%20stay%20in%20the%20NBA,%20attitude%20decides%20everything/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In an NBA regular season game that ended at noon on November 20, the Lakers beat thunder 112-107 at home, winning five consecutive games, while further consolidating the position of No. 1 in the West. Zhan’s data is 25 + 11 + 10, the fifth triple double this season and the 86th in his career. Meanwhile, Zhan is the first player to win triple double against 30 teams in the NBA. Including bushmei, 13 of 24 in this game, the feel is very explosive, 34 points and 7 rebounds. But to be honest, today’s Lakers victory is very difficult!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Three points, six boards and two blocks, Howard tells Anthony with action if you want to stay in the NBA, attitude decides everything/1f0c37855b704d6cae7b34ce2ffe505c.jpg" alt="Three points, six boards and two blocks, Howard tells Anthony with action if you want to stay in the NBA, attitude decides everything"><br>Howard, who played 17 minutes today, was cut to pieces. He shot 2 times, got 3 points and 6 rebounds. The official figure is 2 blocked shots and 3 fouls. On data, it’s not the most gorgeous, it’s not comparable to McKee, but today Howard deserves applause. Howard explains what team spirit is with action.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Three points, six boards and two blocks, Howard tells Anthony with action if you want to stay in the NBA, attitude decides everything/c6c97fd97f0248c2ba0333e6efb4660b.jpg" alt="Three points, six boards and two blocks, Howard tells Anthony with action if you want to stay in the NBA, attitude decides everything"><br>In the first quarter, Howard didn’t play. In the second quarter, Vogel put Howard on. With Rondo and Jen, thunder played a small climax under the leadership of substitute Schroeder. Schroeder felt very hot today, scoring 31 points alone. But after Howard came on the court, a big cap Paul and a big cap Gallinari. In addition, at least five goals were due to Howard Take off interference, but let thunder not hit, although not touch the ball is not a cap, but seriously affect the opponent’s angle and vision.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Three points, six boards and two blocks, Howard tells Anthony with action if you want to stay in the NBA, attitude decides everything/181e3467a2f741d1a5aa6000aba97ebf.jpg" alt="Three points, six boards and two blocks, Howard tells Anthony with action if you want to stay in the NBA, attitude decides everything"><br>In the third quarter, Howard had only 4 minutes, but he was crazy about grabbing the front rebounds. Wang Meng said that the front rebounds of the Lakers were the battle between Howard and the four people opposite. Indeed, this is the value of Howard. Even if his teammates don’t have any hope for the rebounds in the front court, Howard will fight every round. As long as it’s the area under his basket, he will fight every ball. But in the fourth quarter, Vogel continued to change, Rondo and pop partner backcourt, old Zhan came to the fourth position, the brow top to the fifth position, Howard did not get the chance to play, the whole game 3 points 6 rebounds.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Three points, six boards and two blocks, Howard tells Anthony with action if you want to stay in the NBA, attitude decides everything/20dab6fccfb64155bc6c7910c1df16ae.jpg" alt="Three points, six boards and two blocks, Howard tells Anthony with action if you want to stay in the NBA, attitude decides everything"><br>In fact, in today’s Lakers lineup, in the mind of coach Vogel, Howard is not the super giant who can replace James alone, or the star who can design tactics around him. What Howard can do on the court is the dirtiest and most tiring work: fight for rebounds, block the shooting line of the other side, and stick meat under the basket! Even with pop’s eyes, Howard is the first to speed up to the top, pick and roll for his teammates, and then run to the position first whether they give the ball or not. Can Howard do more? I believe that if he has enough ball power and enough tactics to play around him, Howard can still easily average 20 + 10 per game, but this is the Lakers. If he wants to stay in the Lakers, he can only do the work that no one else can do, but he once hated the most.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Three points, six boards and two blocks, Howard tells Anthony with action if you want to stay in the NBA, attitude decides everything/8d448cc758674230994eed22e07ba31a.jpg" alt="Three points, six boards and two blocks, Howard tells Anthony with action if you want to stay in the NBA, attitude decides everything"><br>Howard actually taught Anthony a lesson when he finished the pioneer’s first show earlier today. Today’s first show of Anthony was regarded as the team’s top card by the pioneer. Three crazy players, mclem, betsmore and simonso, gave him the chance to throw the ball, whether it was the chance or not. And Anthony did slow down the team’s attack rhythm, Pelican just hit the counter attack to successfully open the difference. To be honest, Anthony’s debut is not very satisfying.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/Three points, six boards and two blocks, Howard tells Anthony with action if you want to stay in the NBA, attitude decides everything/318385b230c54183b3dc86a01b0558e0.jpg" alt="Three points, six boards and two blocks, Howard tells Anthony with action if you want to stay in the NBA, attitude decides everything"><br>In fact, Anthony and Howard are the same kind of people, the heart is higher than the sky! Once brilliant resume and status let them have enough capital to ask for more, but up to now, Anthony has been waiting for work for a whole year. After the official debut, there is basically no change. The defensive end is still very loose, and the offensive end accounts for a high proportion of the ball rights, which is not suitable for the pioneer’s double shot play. Howard told Anthony with action: want to stay in the NBA, attitude is everything.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Lakers face the warriors back to back. Although the Lakers don’t play bushmei and Rondo, but from the lineup, the strength of the Warriors is still a few grades away from the Lakers. Theoretically, if the Lakers don’t have any big accidents, they should easily win two consecutive games. Even if pop doesn’t score, it’s hard for the Lakers to lose.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Three section clock in! 26 minutes to cut 23 + 6 + 12 + 1 + 1 + 4, he led the team easily beat Warriors/2aaa440df20b487d8c491a7f92eca7cd.jpg" alt="Three section clock in! 26 minutes to cut 23 + 6 + 12 + 1 + 1 + 4, he led the team easily beat Warriors"><br>In the first quarter, James started the game as usual, passing the air relay to McGee in the middle line. The last game was defended in the sun. This time, it was successful in the warriors, because the warriors basically didn’t defend. At the beginning of the game, the defense of both sides was relatively lax. James was very interested in attacking at the beginning. He hit the three-point ball and the mid shot when he came up. Russell played the pick and roll on the warrior side. When there was a grip, he passed it to his teammates. Basically, it was such a tactic.<br>7 minutes into the game, the Lakers changed the defense strategy, hit Russell, forced him to play, let other warriors players deal with the ball, the single defense is easier, the Lakers defend down to fight back, under the leadership of James, the combination of shooting and sudden, soon pulled the score to double-digit difference. After James went down, Kutz came to lead the team immediately. Although he didn’t have the strong point of attack like bushbrow, the good thing was that there was an attack core, and the Lakers’ attack was relatively smooth on the whole. Most players were willing to share the ball. In the first quarter, the two sides played 26-38, and the Lakers were 12 points ahead.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Three section clock in! 26 minutes to cut 23 + 6 + 12 + 1 + 1 + 4, he led the team easily beat Warriors/380e8e61bdb64327b6d929959febdd87.jpg" alt="Three section clock in! 26 minutes to cut 23 + 6 + 12 + 1 + 1 + 4, he led the team easily beat Warriors"><br>The next quarter of the game, to 11 minutes, the warriors attack errors, the Lakers attack defense conversion, pop under the fast break score, finally, pop scored! In the rotation period of the second quarter, including the last four minutes of the first quarter, Howard dominated the warrior’s interior line at both ends of attack and defense, frantically scrambled for the front rebounds, caused many fouls under the basket, obtained many free throws, and stabilized the difference at more than 14 points.<br>After James came back in the middle of the second quarter, he once pulled the score to 18 points, but the Lakers were too careless, and even sent four mistakes, allowing the warriors to catch up with the score to 8 points. In the last four minutes, it was almost James who was chasing points with the ball, but James shot all the shots except one shot. The Lakers and warriors drew 29 in a single quarter and changed the score to 67-55 before half-time.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Three section clock in! 26 minutes to cut 23 + 6 + 12 + 1 + 1 + 4, he led the team easily beat Warriors/03dd5fdae3ff491ebba36c734f15db42.jpg" alt="Three section clock in! 26 minutes to cut 23 + 6 + 12 + 1 + 1 + 4, he led the team easily beat Warriors"><br>In the third quarter, James mainly assists teammates, in series games, combs the attack, Kuzma and McGee are fed comfortably, and the Lakers pull the difference to more than 20 points in three minutes. But then the Lakers hit a decline, errors began to increase, warriors three-point role players hit three-point ball, Russell also hit in the middle distance, soon will catch up with the difference back to about 10 points. James played nearly 10 minutes in the third quarter, and wanted to take the game off in the fourth quarter. Before he went down, the Lakers kept the score above 15 points. The last two points were ruled by Howard’s attack and defense, and the Lakers stabilized the difference at 16 points.<br>At the end of the game, the Lakers’ backup players played well on the court. Compared with the warriors, the strength of the Lakers is really that level. The Lakers have Caruso and cook on the outside as a simple organization, and Howard on the inside as a guard, so the warriors can be clearly arranged. In the fourth quarter, the Lakers kept the score above 10, James didn’t play again, and the final score was 94-120. Staples fans have benefits to enjoy.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Three section clock in! 26 minutes to cut 23 + 6 + 12 + 1 + 1 + 4, he led the team easily beat Warriors/d640ac07429341d3bb7f337e42f4ae6e.jpg" alt="Three section clock in! 26 minutes to cut 23 + 6 + 12 + 1 + 1 + 4, he led the team easily beat Warriors"><br>In the whole game, James played three quarters, played 26 minutes, made 11 of 21 shots, got 23 points, 6 rebounds, 12 assists, 1 steals, 1 block, 4 mistakes, plus or minus value + 13. Without bushmei and Rondo, he easily took the game down. The whole game was only played in the beginning. In the third quarter, the Lakers fell into the predicament of many mistakes, but they did not succeed, but hit the iron crazily. But warriors are not the five giants of the past, they can’t play the climax of attack in the third quarter, let alone the Lakers make four mistakes, even if they make 10 consecutive mistakes, relying on Howard’s defense, with Warriors as a team, they can’t reverse the 20 point advantage.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/17/Three section clock in! 26 minutes to cut 23 + 6 + 12 + 1 + 1 + 4, he led the team easily beat Warriors/a66db17d414e4eac8c57aa51dec54790.jpg" alt="Three section clock in! 26 minutes to cut 23 + 6 + 12 + 1 + 1 + 4, he led the team easily beat Warriors"><br>For warriors, Russell played 31 minutes, made 6 of 13 shots, got 21 points, 8 assists and 5 mistakes, with a plus or minus value of - 27. The Lakers put a lot of pressure on Russell. Russell likes to play pick and roll, and the strategy the Lakers adopt is to bag him. If it’s OK to play pick and roll with green, the warriors still have people to organize the game. If it’s other players, it’s only shooting, and colistan can also slam down. If other players, the Lakers basically let them shoot. Vogel believes that, besides Russell Other players of Italy can’t beat the Lakers.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/To the top three in history! 39.2 points per game + 148 points net difference! Brother alphabet, he's not only going to rob your MVP/5ff3e60dafab4e3cb0accbb7db407fb5.jpg" alt="To the top three in history! 39.2 points per game + 148 points net difference! Brother alphabet, he&#39;s not only going to rob your MVP"><br>On November 19, in today’s focus match, harden and Lillard met. As two super stars, they are both good at singles. The new season has been playing for nearly a month. At present, these two players are also the top two in the new season’s total score. Harden’s total score is 549 points, while Lillard’s only 401 points. In the MVP ranking released a few days ago, the Bucks’ alphabet brother still ranked first, James ranked second, while harden quietly rose to third. In addition, Walker ranked fourth, which was surprising. Raptors’ new nuclear sikam ranked fifth.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/To the top three in history! 39.2 points per game + 148 points net difference! Brother alphabet, he's not only going to rob your MVP/28382c2246fb4464a6e7d3acfcbe1e1c.jpg" alt="To the top three in history! 39.2 points per game + 148 points net difference! Brother alphabet, he&#39;s not only going to rob your MVP"><br>In today’s game, in the face of the league’s scoring second only to his own Lillard, harden showed a crazy offensive talent, playing 33 minutes in 19 11, of which 3-point 10-5, cut 36 points + 6 rebounds + 5 assists, while Lillard was in an all-round inferior position with Wes, only got 13 points, 11 assists and 6 rebounds, let alone compared with harden. In fact, Hadden’s data today is not even up to his average this season!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/To the top three in history! 39.2 points per game + 148 points net difference! Brother alphabet, he's not only going to rob your MVP/30bd6ab73536404d9364187c026cb190.jpg" alt="To the top three in history! 39.2 points per game + 148 points net difference! Brother alphabet, he&#39;s not only going to rob your MVP"><br>In the 14 games of the new season, only one game scores less than 20, two games are between 20-29, and the rest are all over 35 points. In the last five games, it is even more disappointing data: 39 + 9 + 4; 47 + 7 + 6; 44 + 5 + 8; 49 + 6 + 5; 36 + 5 + 6. Harden’s current average score is 39.2 points, the second letter brother, only 30.3 points per game, the gap between the two sides reached 8.9 points, making people despair!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/To the top three in history! 39.2 points per game + 148 points net difference! Brother alphabet, he's not only going to rob your MVP/5a6d627ced7640e7a5f66836620147b2.jpg" alt="To the top three in history! 39.2 points per game + 148 points net difference! Brother alphabet, he&#39;s not only going to rob your MVP"><br>Hardon’s ruling level data is based on the extremely high ball ownership. At present, the possession rate of Hardon round is 39.7% (the first in the League), while the real hit rate is 61.8% (the 57th in the League). In the NBA players’ game contribution value list, Hardon is far behind Paul George, alphabet brother, Dongqi, Leonard, James, etc., only ranking the 10th in the league.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/To the top three in history! 39.2 points per game + 148 points net difference! Brother alphabet, he's not only going to rob your MVP/4549b5d8befd45c889138fe15e204f2b.jpg" alt="To the top three in history! 39.2 points per game + 148 points net difference! Brother alphabet, he&#39;s not only going to rob your MVP"><br>Although Hardon’s hit rate and contribution value are very common, if he keeps the current average score of 39.2 points, he can reach the top three in NBA single season average score record! NBA history ranked first is Chamberlain’s record of 50.4 points per game in 1961-1962 season, which is basically hard to break; the second is Chamberlain’s record of 44.8 points per game in 62-63 season, which is also insurmountable; Chamberlain’s record of 38.4 points per game in 60-61 season is likely to be broken by harden! It’s important to know that in the NBA history list, the top five points per game in the season are all created in ancient times. If harden can make it to this list, it’s a new history!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/To the top three in history! 39.2 points per game + 148 points net difference! Brother alphabet, he's not only going to rob your MVP/00c12dc57df447d99801a677c80e7165.jpg" alt="To the top three in history! 39.2 points per game + 148 points net difference! Brother alphabet, he&#39;s not only going to rob your MVP"><br>At present, Hardon has a hot hand. In addition, he has been leading the team to the top two in the western region, and is in hot pursuit of James. If Hardon keeps such horrible data, I believe that he is still one of the most popular MVP players. Compared with last season, Hardon’s data is more luxurious. In the comparison between the data column and the mother brother, it’s one-sided! It seems that Hardon’s goal this season is not just to get back the MVP, but to rewrite the history.</p>

    <title>Two hits 60 + 19! 5 points in a row at the last moment. The clipper is in a dilemma. It&#39;s worth 30 million yuan a year</title>
    <url>/2019/11/10/Two%20hits%2060%20+%2019!%205%20points%20in%20a%20row%20at%20the%20last%20moment.%20The%20clipper%20is%20in%20a%20dilemma.%20It&#39;s%20worth%2030%20million%20yuan%20a%20year/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a game that ended today, the Clippers lost 107-101 to the Blazers in three straight games. Leonard is finally back in this game, but he is not in good shape. Just like teacher Yang Yi said, after the comeback of Xiao Ka, his feet are still a little empty. I don’t know if the truce will work. But from what it felt like on the field, Leonard was a little rusty. In the first quarter, his outside touch was not smooth, and he could only get some points by breaking things. But Leonard still has a bright spot on the defensive side, such as blocking Whiteside Whiteside. In the face of Lillard, it’s time to play the game of death.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Two hits 60 + 19! 5 points in a row at the last moment. The clipper is in a dilemma. It's worth 30 million yuan a year/515522d1fb2c4fa8a7ef4e7986552cb9.jpg" alt="Two hits 60 + 19! 5 points in a row at the last moment. The clipper is in a dilemma. It&#39;s worth 30 million yuan a year"><br>As old Rivers said after the game, it was the Clippers’ third defensive win of the season. Old rivers also admitted that today’s small card played in general, the Clippers did not play in the offensive end of the normal level. But in the end you can win, and that’s the benefit of defense. In addition, old rivers also praised Leonard. When he only got 9 points in the first three quarters, he scored 18 points in the last quarter. Leonard’s fighting will still let old rivers name and praise constantly.<br>At the end of the day, Leonard did. When the clipper was on the brink of extinction, he could always break out. Within 12 minutes, he broke down the trailblazer wall.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Two hits 60 + 19! 5 points in a row at the last moment. The clipper is in a dilemma. It's worth 30 million yuan a year/6f0214d26fc64dbba810d3d0239a25e8.jpg" alt="Two hits 60 + 19! 5 points in a row at the last moment. The clipper is in a dilemma. It&#39;s worth 30 million yuan a year"><br>First in the middle with the ball in the distance, and then several strong attack the basket. Even hit 2 points in the counterattack. Then came another emergency stop distance. Leonard brought the clipper out of the cliff by himself. Overall, Leonard’s 27 points, 13 rebounds, 4 assists and 2 blocks are satisfactory.<br>Of course, at the last minute, the Clippers also gave me strength. He scored five points in a row, becoming the second butcher besides Leonard. If Leonard put the trailblazers on the floor in the way of killing pigs, Luwei gave the trailblazers a direct blow to the heart, making them bleed.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Two hits 60 + 19! 5 points in a row at the last moment. The clipper is in a dilemma. It's worth 30 million yuan a year/b3e1565181194761931ac804e2477847.jpg" alt="Two hits 60 + 19! 5 points in a row at the last moment. The clipper is in a dilemma. It&#39;s worth 30 million yuan a year"><br>In the whole game, Lu Wei scored 26 points, 3 rebounds and 8 assists in 29 minutes. It’s worth mentioning that in the absence of Leonard in the last game, Dewey scored 34 points, 6 rebounds and 11 assists against the Bucks, while Letterman was no inferior to Biao. In the two games, Luwei has scored 60 + 19 + 9 of the heroic data, which is a giant performance.<br>So far this season, Dewey has played 9 games for clippers, averaging 22.4 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.7 assists in 31.6 minutes. This kind of data can earn 30 million annual salary in the current alliance.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Two hits 60 + 19! 5 points in a row at the last moment. The clipper is in a dilemma. It's worth 30 million yuan a year/05fc005b979047a1b93632ae32a470c2.jpg" alt="Two hits 60 + 19! 5 points in a row at the last moment. The clipper is in a dilemma. It&#39;s worth 30 million yuan a year"><br>It can only be said that the Clippers are in trouble. What’s the next contract they should give to Ludwig? According to the current data of Ludwig, we can compare them with Middleton and Harris. They both got the top salary of 180 million dollars in five years this summer. The only bad thing about Luwei is that he’s 33 years old. In the summer of 18, Luwei and clipper signed a three-year low-cost contract of $24 million, and the new contract expires in the summer of 2021. By then, Dewey might be 35. But the annual salary of 8 million is really too little. Why should the express ship give more than 10 million? Like Beverly’s three years of 40 million.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Two hits 60 + 19! 5 points in a row at the last moment. The clipper is in a dilemma. It's worth 30 million yuan a year/f0665d4649b648d89ba4d0e7a9174633.jpg" alt="Two hits 60 + 19! 5 points in a row at the last moment. The clipper is in a dilemma. It&#39;s worth 30 million yuan a year"><br>In terms of the team’s position, the Clippers are really lack of Luwei. The combination of him and Harrell complements each other. Harrell and Dewey have problems on the defensive side, but they are basically invincible when they cooperate on the offensive side. Harrell down to attract the defender, Lu Wei outside holding the ball, you can cut in to feed Harrell bread, you can also choose their own shots or points outside shooter, this is Lu Wei’s attack three threats.</p>

    <title>Wait 7 years! Davis speaks to the Lakers, Vogel showdown, James, Walton</title>
    <url>/2019/11/10/Wait%207%20years!%20Davis%20speaks%20to%20the%20Lakers,%20Vogel%20showdown,%20James,%20Walton/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Los Angeles Lakers have set sail this season and they have won seven straight games, the first in a row in the past eight years. What’s more surprising is that the Lakers’ two cores are seamless. James and Davis are like old partners who have worked together for several seasons, compared to the incompatibility between Russell and Curie. In the last heat game, under Wade’s attention. James and Davis scored 51 out of 21 of 36.<br>James scored 25 + 4 + 6 in 36 minutes, Davis 26 + 8 + 7 in 35 minutes.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Wait 7 years! Davis speaks to the Lakers, Vogel showdown, James, Walton/bd1d4cf4ce3f43aa822989d724f3b60a.jpg" alt="Wait 7 years! Davis speaks to the Lakers, Vogel showdown, James, Walton"><br>The Lakers only scored 80 points in the game, and their choking defense was astounding. When he was a pelican, Davis had a hard time. Not only do we have to do our best on the offensive side, but no one is feeding the pancakes. Finally, one of Rondo was released by the pelican. On the other hand, Davis is on the defensive side of the pelican defense system.<br>Now the Lakers have James in charge of the offensive end of the series, the defensive end does not need Davis to fight alone. The Lakers are supported by Howard, green and Bradley. James Ken is also a great barrier when defending. In addition, umamba Caruso is also a defense leader. When talking about how he felt about joining the Lakers today, Davis was so excited that he said what he had been thinking for seven years.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Wait 7 years! Davis speaks to the Lakers, Vogel showdown, James, Walton/cdee6ae2db574ff1877a71c0958ffa18.jpg" alt="Wait 7 years! Davis speaks to the Lakers, Vogel showdown, James, Walton"><br>Davies said: “our defense in the new season is very terrible. When we played at the heat before, the opponents could score more than 110 points per game. And we only gave them 80 points. We forced them to shoot hard, forcing them to make only 17% of the three-point shots. That’s why I love this team. My combination with LeBron is two poisons. We can shoot or pass. You have to choose a bottle of poison. “<br>Davis didn’t do well when he was a pelican. Over the years, he made a playoff round two. This time in the Lakers he ushered in a good opportunity to directly win the championship, and play easily.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Wait 7 years! Davis speaks to the Lakers, Vogel showdown, James, Walton/551fc23723b642a8b5d6b573973daac9.jpg" alt="Wait 7 years! Davis speaks to the Lakers, Vogel showdown, James, Walton"><br>Finally, Lakers coach Vogel also talked about the use of LeBron James in the new season, and what’s different from the use of James by Walton last season. Vogel’s showdown and giving the ball to James is always the best choice. There is no choice but to give the ball to James can give full play to his value.<br>Vogel’s idea is totally different from Wharton’s equalitarianism. Last season, Wharton reduced James’s holding time, so that he could go to hold the ball at a critical time to play singles. James did it for a time, but he was hurt at last.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Wait 7 years! Davis speaks to the Lakers, Vogel showdown, James, Walton/9a052a6234ed4d23ba9031ffcb71558b.jpg" alt="Wait 7 years! Davis speaks to the Lakers, Vogel showdown, James, Walton"><br>But at the end of the day it’s wisest to give the ball to the 23rd, and tyrenlu did a good job at that.<br>“It’s a very right choice to let LeBron control the ball, but it’s not a good choice. Because holding the ball is the best way to play LeBron. Give him the ball and let him decide for himself when to be decisive and when to pass to his teammates. Because the way he reads defense is incredible. When you have a player like that, you should let him play the role of team engine * * “<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Wait 7 years! Davis speaks to the Lakers, Vogel showdown, James, Walton/9b578895d1fe4ae1956d3d8d3cc7b8d2.jpg" alt="Wait 7 years! Davis speaks to the Lakers, Vogel showdown, James, Walton"><br>In the past, when he was in the Cavaliers, tyrenlu gave the ball to James without missing the finals and winning the championship. But the Cavaliers’ lineup is unable to compare with the present Lakers’ lineup, this year Lakers has the very hope.</p>

    <title>Waiting for two years to meet Bole! Harrell thanks old rivers, Beverly to go through fire and water for him</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Clippers won, they narrowly beat the Blazers, and Leonard’s comeback in this game undoubtedly helped the Clippers. He scored 18 points at the end of the first three quarters to finish the harvest. In the whole game, Leonard made 9 of 23 shots in 33 minutes, 0 of 5 three-point shots and 9 of 10 free throws, contributing 27 points, 13 rebounds, 4 assists, 1 steals and 2 blocks.<br>Leonard has really changed this season. After the Spurs were injured, Leonard is more concerned about his health. In raptors, he took turns to keep himself energetic, which also made Raptors win the championship. Health care is the key to Leonard’s success in the finals.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Waiting for two years to meet Bole!

Harrell thanks old rivers, Beverly to go through fire and water for him"><br>After today’s game, Leonard also talked about the clipper being fined by the League because of his rotation, which Leonard thought was disappointing. But he will not compromise and will continue to follow his own way to ensure his health. In other words, Leonard’s rotation plan will not change. Leonard also said that he was not interested in the regular season MVP. He just wanted to win the championship again.<br>For the clipper manager old rivers, Leonard’s presence really gave them a sea calming needle. Of course, old rivers is also worthy of the title. In the past two seasons, the clippers have been in the rebuilding phase. Griffin + Paul + little Jordan all stay in the team.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Waiting for two years to meet Bole!

Harrell thanks old rivers, Beverly to go through fire and water for him"><br>But old rivers made it to the playoffs with some of the players he thought were small cards. Thanks to Jerry West for helping the team get the three cores of Beverly + luway + Harrell in the process of trading Paul. These three men are the key to the Clippers’ six matches against warriors last season, and they have saved the Clippers from adversity many times this season. Among them, the combination field of Luwei and Harrell can contribute 40 points, which is very scary data.<br>However, these players are reluctant to talk about their performance, but publicly thank old rivers, who became bole of the three.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Waiting for two years to meet Bole! Harrell thanks old rivers, Beverly to go through fire and water for him/14ca66560a58454fa47080baf408f2d4.jpg" alt="Waiting for two years to meet Bole! Harrell thanks old rivers, Beverly to go through fire and water for him"><br>In a certain team, Harrell is the least important. One year when playing spurs, Ming Harrell was very healthy, but he was abandoned by moustache. After joining the clippers, the aggrieved Harrell has played the best two seasons in his career. This season, Harrell is about to play his third successful season. Lu Wei also played a high-profile performance under old rivers.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Waiting for two years to meet Bole! Harrell thanks old rivers, Beverly to go through fire and water for him/6143cd337b394e63961ffd4b4a2f3580.jpg" alt="Waiting for two years to meet Bole! Harrell thanks old rivers, Beverly to go through fire and water for him"><br>After today’s game, Ludwig and Harrell thanked old rivers publicly: “today, our coach rivers became the 13th regular season coach in NBA history to win 900 games. Harrell just splashed water on him to celebrate. So as I said, rivers is a great coach, a champion coach. I will try to win the championship with him. It’s very comfortable to play under him. “ * *<br>In addition to Ludwig and Harrell, Beverly also thanked old rivers after the game. Bever used a word to describe old rivers. He can let the players be himself and know all kinds of tactics.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Waiting for two years to meet Bole! Harrell thanks old rivers, Beverly to go through fire and water for him/d07a29878cd243208f2bdd30331d68d3.jpg" alt="Waiting for two years to meet Bole! Harrell thanks old rivers, Beverly to go through fire and water for him"><br>In addition, Beverly also said frankly that old rivers is not the kind of coach who has to manage everything. He won’t let you shoot what kind of shots you have to shoot. So Beverly summed up a sentence at the end: “when you meet such a coach, you will always go through fire and water for him!”<br>It’s known to those who have seen Harrell + Ludwig + Beverly play in the Clippers that if they continue to stay with a certain team, Ludwig and Beverly are not easy to say, but Harrell will definitely be used up.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Lakers are about to face the heat. This game will still focus on Wade and LeBron James. Although Wade has retired, but the heat reporter winderman reported that wade still decided to go to Staples Center to watch the heat against the Lakers live, he and Riley will watch their good brother James brave performance.<br>The heat are currently 6-2, second in the East. It’s worth mentioning that Anthony Chiang, another hot team reporter, reported before the game. The heat have three players who will be absent, Jones + Winslow + wells.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Willing to work hard for the Lakers Howard showed his loyalty and took the lead in sacrifice/6d9fabd7c9754b86a76156affcc137f9.jpg" alt="Willing to work hard for the Lakers Howard showed his loyalty and took the lead in sacrifice"><br>The Lakers also missed a lot of fierce players, Bradley has not yet decided whether to play, Rondo although coming back, but not today, but to wait until the next game. The key to the Lakers’ win today is defense and rebounding protection. The heat is a tough team. Like Kuzma said, the Lakers can’t start slowly, and they should do a good job in defense at the same time.<br>Obviously, Davis and Howard are going to be ready for the Lakers’ interior today. In the past few games, McGrady has not been reused by Vogel. Although he started, he played almost the same time as the substitute, only 10 minutes. Howard’s time per game has risen to 22 minutes.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Willing to work hard for the Lakers Howard showed his loyalty and took the lead in sacrifice/92ad3164fae14b4fab5e0156f08d7324.jpg" alt="Willing to work hard for the Lakers Howard showed his loyalty and took the lead in sacrifice"><br>Howard has played seven games for the Lakers this season, averaging 22 minutes, getting 6.7 points, 7.9 rebounds, 1.1 assists, 0.71 steals 2.14 blocks, with a shooting percentage of 78.6%. Obviously Howard’s integration is much better than the Lakers fans think, and Howard is modest and low-key now. Unlike when he worked with Kobe Bryant in the past, Howard didn’t like to pick and roll. He did all these dirty work and liked to go to the low post singles.<br>And there is not much enthusiasm on the field, just like children. If you give him the ball to play singles, he will have enthusiasm. If you don’t give the ball, the enthusiasm will come down, which is similar to giving candy.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Willing to work hard for the Lakers Howard showed his loyalty and took the lead in sacrifice/893fba9385e94507b2fcbb14b0ea5aaa.jpg" alt="Willing to work hard for the Lakers Howard showed his loyalty and took the lead in sacrifice"><br>But seven years later, Howard left the Lakers to have a taste of the world’s variety of ways, human feelings. In a certain team and 13 beard had a conflict, went to his hometown eagle was also traded by the team. To the Hornet is to be rejected by the young people, and finally to the Wizards have not played a few games on the back injury. Howard is on the verge of retiring this summer, although the Lakers only give him a base salary contract. If it wasn’t for the Lakers to offer a base salary contract, Howard would be the next Anthony.<br>Because most people are worried about Howard, will become a cancer of the dressing room, coupled with his physical decline, few teams will give him a chance. And Howard joined the Lakers, he also asked for low-key.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Willing to work hard for the Lakers Howard showed his loyalty and took the lead in sacrifice/9b17c43202f741048c74c057c9df9de6.jpg" alt="Willing to work hard for the Lakers Howard showed his loyalty and took the lead in sacrifice"><br>This makes Howard look like walking on thin ice. Today, Howard shows his loyalty to the Lakers again, not only showing his attitude to the Lakers, but also showing his new face to all the teams in the league, so as to get a pension contract in the future.<br>Howard is willing to work hard and sacrifice for the Lakers when talking about the substitutes: “* * I am grateful that the Lakers gave me a chance to prove myself and fight for the championship again. I told myself when I joined the Lakers. Whenever the team sends me out and arranges me to play any role, I can’t complain, but I want to keep myself in the best condition. I’m a defensive blue collar now, because defense is the foundation of my life in this league. I don’t care how many shots I make in a game. I’m just for you!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/10/Willing to work hard for the Lakers Howard showed his loyalty and took the lead in sacrifice/60b9d1e1aca148978d8c6957270e78c2.jpg" alt="Willing to work hard for the Lakers Howard showed his loyalty and took the lead in sacrifice"><br>After 2012, the 34 year old Warcraft finally woke up, just like Howard did when Davis commented. Now Howard is humble and full of energy. He has directly turned the energy of the past into the driving force of the present game.</p>

    <title>The sky changes in the West! Last season, the two teams of the Western Conference met at the end of the table. The Spurs lost six times in a row and the thunder came</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>On November 20, there are fewer NBA games today, but the teams in the West ranking are coming out one after another. Warriors beat Grizzlies 114-95 on the road, ending seven consecutive defeats, but there is no fluctuation in the ranking, far from the pelican in front of them. After losing to the pelican, the Blazers have been kicked to the second lowest position in the west by the pelican. With this victory, the pelican also successfully overtakes the Spurs in a curve!<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/The sky changes in the West! Last season, the two teams of the Western Conference met at the end of the table.

Last season, the two teams of the Western Conference met at the end of the table. The Spurs lost six times in a row and the thunder came/f6ef33bc236d4bdeb3053fb2ff406a2d.jpg" alt="The sky changes in the West! Last season, the two teams of the Western Conference met at the end of the table. The Spurs lost six times in a row and the thunder came"><br>First, let’s talk about the Spurs. The Spurs have experienced a wave of three consecutive wins in the opening game. Since losing to the Lakers, their condition has plummeted, including losing to the eagles and Celtics in a row. In the last six games, they have all lost! There are many reasons in the middle. Sometimes drozan is in the doldrums, sometimes adelain is in the doldrums. Popovich is also a bit stubborn and inflexible in the tactical arrangement of the Spurs. The guard line of the Spurs is fixed and rotated. After Derozan mentioned position 3, he actually weakened the ball right of the guard line. The Spurs has not been a team that is good at shooting three points, but Derozan has not.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/The sky changes in the West! Last season, the two teams of the Western Conference met at the end of the table.

Last season, the two teams of the Western Conference met at the end of the table. The Spurs lost six times in a row and the thunder came"><br>Next summer, drozan’s contract expires, he urgently needs gorgeous data and team performance to seek a top salary contract, which is also contrary to the original team basketball of the Spurs. To be sure, the Spurs’ poor performance is not accidental. The players need to change, and the coaches need to change. What’s more, ADEE is one year old, and the so-called guard line talent generation of the Spurs still hasn’t It’s coming out.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/The sky changes in the West! Last season, the two teams of the Western Conference met at the end of the table. The Spurs lost six times in a row and the thunder came/67ed74f3ec8e4330a36da0be41e4c073.jpg" alt="The sky changes in the West! Last season, the two teams of the Western Conference met at the end of the table. The Spurs lost six times in a row and the thunder came"><br>The Blazers had a good start, three wins and two defeats. The game of losing 76 at home was also a one point loss in overtime. But since the trailblazers lost to the warriors without four superstars, they have started their own decline: losing clippers, nets, kings and raptors, and recently losing spurs, mosaic and pelicans! The trailblazer management signed Anthony to make up for the lack of frontline strength. Today, Anthony made 4 in 14, got 10 points and 5 mistakes. To be honest, it’s average! If Antony continues to play after Lillard’s return, his marriage with the team will not be long.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/The sky changes in the West!

Last season, the two teams of the Western Conference met at the end of the table. The Spurs lost six times in a row and the thunder came"><br>Of course, the Blazers usually start their own crazy winning streak around the All-Star weekend. It’s too early to say that the Blazers didn’t make it to the playoffs, but it’s true that they have successfully met the warriors.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/The sky changes in the West! Last season, the two teams of the Western Conference met at the end of the table.

Last season, the two teams of the Western Conference met at the end of the table. The Spurs lost six times in a row and the thunder came"><br>Warriors really don’t have much fighting power. After Durant’s reluctant farewell, clay’s season reimbursement, Curie fracture, Russell injury stop, Green’s attack and defense ends are not supported by a few superstars, and his embellishment effect doesn’t look very bright. But today, warriors still won a game. Green contributed 8 points, 11 rebounds, 10 assists, and the most meritorious person should remember In Berks, now green is more like the manager of the chef in the hotel. It’s impossible to expect him to cook. But you can point out to all the new chefs. Who makes him old.<br><img src="http://maidys.xyz/2019/11/23/The sky changes in the West!

Last season, the two teams of the Western Conference met at the end of the table. The Spurs lost six times in a row and the thunder came"><br>Three missing one! In the future, there is also room for thunder to decline. We need to know that in the five games that thunder won this season, they are all at home, and the away record is an embarrassing five consecutive defeats! Today, it’s tough for the Lakers, and the pelican’s schedule in the future is also desperate. Three days later, continue to play the Lakers, and then play the warriors and blazers away. If the thunder keeps losing, then the four playoff teams of last season will gather at the end of the western conference table only one month after the start of this season!</p>
